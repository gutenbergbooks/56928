<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">It</span> is not surprising that many persons, not familiar with the wild and
wondrous events of the past, should judge that many of the honest narratives
of history must be fictions—mere romances. But it is difficult
for the imagination to invent scenes more wonderful than can be found
in the annals of by-gone days. The novelist who should create such a
character as that of Frederick William, or such a career as that of Frederick
the Great, would be deemed guilty of great exaggeration, and yet
the facts contained in this volume are beyond all contradiction.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlyle has written the Life of Frederick the Great in six closely
printed volumes of over five hundred pages each. It is a work of much
ability and accuracy. There are, however, but few persons, in this busy
age, who can find time to read three thousand pages of fine type, descriptive
of events, many of which have lost their interest, and have ceased to
possess any practical value. Still, the student who has leisure to peruse
these voluminous annals of all the prominent actors in Europe during
the reign of Frederick and of his half-insane father, will find a rich treat
in the wonderfully graphic and accurate pages of Carlyle.</p>

<p>This volume is intended to give a clear and correct idea of the man—of
his public and private character, and of his career. It would be difficult
to find, in the whole range of English literature, a theme more full of
the elements of entertainment and instruction.</p>

<p>The reader of these pages will be oppressed with the consciousness of
how vast a proportion of the miseries of humanity is caused by the cruelty
of man to his brother man. This globe might be a very happy home for
those who dwell upon it. But its history, during the last six thousand
years, has presented one of the most appalling tragedies of which the
imagination can conceive. Among all the renowned warriors of the
past, but few can be found who have contributed more to fill the world
with desolated homes, with the moans of the dying, with the cry of the
widow and the orphan, than Frederick the Great; but he laid the foundations
of an empire which is at this moment the most potent upon the
globe.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">On</span> the southern coasts of the Baltic Sea, between the latitudes
of 52° and 54°, there lies a country which was first revealed to
civilized eyes about three hundred years before the birth of
Christ. The trading adventurers from Marseilles, who landed
at various points upon the coast, found it a cold, savage region
of lakes, forests, marshy jungles, and sandy wastes. A shaggy
tribe peopled it, of semi-barbarians, almost as wild as the bears,
wolves, and swine which roamed their forests. As the centuries
rolled on, centuries of which, in these remote regions, history
takes no note, but in which the gloomy generations came and
went, shouting, fighting, weeping, dying, gradually the aspect of
a rude civilization spread over those dreary solitudes. The savage
inhabitants, somewhat tamed, increased in numbers, and
there appeared a tall and manly race of fair complexion, light
hair, stern aspect, great physical strength, and very formidable
in battle.</p>

<p>Still centuries elapsed, leaving little for history to record but
war and woe. Fierce tribes swept in all directions. Battle was
life’s great business. Man, ignorant, degraded, brutal, could have
had but few if any joys. Perhaps, through his degradation, his
woes were only such as beasts feel. By degrees, from this chaos,
a certain kind of governmental order emerged. Small tribes became
united under powerful chieftains. Kings arose. There
were all varieties of political organizations, dukedoms, principalities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
marquisates, and electorates. It is recorded that Adalbert,
bishop of Prag, about the year 997, with two companions, as
apostles of Christianity, first penetrated these wilds. Like Christian
heroes they went, with staff and scrip, regardless of danger.
The bishop was fifty years of age, and his gray hairs floated in
the breeze. As he landed a stout savage struck him with the
flat of his oar, and sent him headlong to the ground.</p>

<p>The zealous bishop, perhaps not unwilling to secure the crown
of martyrdom, pressed on, preaching the Gospel, in face of prohibitions
and menaces, until he entered one of the sacred inclosures
which was a sanctuary of the idols of these heathen. The
priests rushed upon him, endeavored to drive him out, and struck
him with a dagger in the back of his neck. He uttered but one
cry, “Jesus, receive me!” and, stretching out his arms, fell with
his face to the ground, and lay dead there “in the form of a crucifix.”
The place is yet pointed out where Adalbert fell. Still
the seeds of Christianity were sown. Other missionaries followed.
Idolatry disappeared, and the realm became nominally
Christian. Revealed religion introduced increased enlightenment
and culture, though there still remained much of the savagery
of ancient days.</p>

<p>When the Reformation in the sixteenth century was presented
to Europe, and was rejected by Italy, France, Austria, and
Spain, it was accepted, though not unanimously, yet very generally,
by the inhabitants of this wild region. In the year 1700
there was, in the midst of the realm of which we are about to
write, and which is now called Prussia, a province then known
as the Marquisate of Brandenburg. It embraced a little over
fifteen thousand square miles, being about twice as large as the
State of Massachusetts. It was one of the electorates of Germany,
and the elector or marquis, Frederick, belonged to the renowned
family of Hohenzollern. To the east of Brandenburg
there was a duchy called Prussia. This duchy, in some of the
political agitations of the times, had been transferred to the Marquis
of Brandenburg. The Elector of Brandenburg, Frederick,
an ambitious man, rejoicing in the extent of his domain, which
was large for a marquisate, though small for a monarchy, obtained
from the Emperor of Germany its recognition as a kingdom,
and assumed the title of Frederick I. of Prussia. Many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the proud monarchies of Europe did not conceal the contempt
with which they regarded this petty kingdom. They received
the elector into their society very much as haughty nobles, proud
of a long line of illustrious ancestry, would receive a successful
merchant who had purchased a title. Frederick himself was
greatly elated with the honor he had attained, and his subjects
shared with him in his exultation.</p>

    <div class="caption">FREDERICK THE GREAT.</div></div>

<p>Berlin was the capital of Brandenburg. Königsberg, an important
sea-port on the Baltic, nearly five hundred miles east of
Berlin, was the capital of the Prussian duchy. The ceremony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
of coronation took place at Königsberg. The road, for most of
the distance, was through a very wild, uncultivated country.
Eighteen hundred carriages, with thirty thousand post-horses,
were provided to convey the court to the scene of coronation.
Such a cavalcade was never beheld in those parts before. The
carriages moved like an army, in three divisions of six hundred
each. Volumes have been written descriptive of the pageant.
It is said that the diamond buttons on the king’s coat cost seven
thousand five hundred dollars each. The streets were not only
tapestried with the richest cloth of the most gorgeous colors, but
many of them were softly carpeted for the feet of the high-born
men and proud dames who contributed, by their picturesque
costume, to the brilliance of the spectacle. Frederick, with his
own hands, placed the crown upon his brow. Thus was the kingdom
of Prussia, ushered into being at the close of the year 1700.</p>

<p>Frederick I. had a son, Frederick William, then twelve years
of age. He accompanied his father upon this coronation tour.
As heir to the throne he was called the Crown Prince. His
mother was a Hanoverian princess, a sister of the Elector George
of Hanover, who subsequently became George I. of England.
George I. did not succeed to the British crown until the death
of Anne, in 1714. When Frederick William was but five years
of age he had been taken by his mother to Hanover, to visit her
brother, then the elector. George had two children—a little
girl, named Sophie Dorothee, a few months older than Frederick
William, and a son, who subsequently became George II. of England.
The two boys did not love each other. They often
quarreled. Though Frederick William was the younger, it is
said that on one occasion he severely beat his cousin, the future
King of England, causing the blood to flow freely. He developed
a very energetic but unamiable character. Among other anecdotes
illustrative of his determined spirit, it is recorded that at
one time, during this visit, his governess ordered some task which
he was unwilling to perform. The headstrong boy sprang out
of the third story window of the castle, and, clinging to the sill
with his hands, threatened to let himself drop. The terrified
Madame Montbail was thus brought to terms.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Sophie Dorothee was a very pretty child. The plan was probably
already contemplated by the parents that the two should
be married in due time. Soon after this Frederick William lost
his mother, and with her all of a mother’s care and gentle influences.
Her place was taken by a step-mother, whose peevishness
and irritability soon developed into maniacal insanity. When
Frederick William was eighteen years of age he was allowed to
choose between three princesses for his wife. He took his pretty
cousin, Sophie Dorothee. They were married with great pomp
on the 28th of November, 1706.</p>

<p>A son was born and died. A daughter came, Wilhelmina.
But a daughter could not inherit the crown. Another son was
born and died. There was great anxiety at court, from fear that
the direct line of succession might not be preserved. But on
the 24th of January, 1712, when the monarchy was but twelve
years old, the little prince was born who subsequently obtained
such renown as Frederick the Great. The king, his grandfather,
was aged and infirm. The excessive joy with which he greeted
little Fritz, as he fondly called the child, was cordially reciprocated
throughout the Prussian nation. The realm blazed with
bonfires and illuminations, and resounded with every demonstration
of public joy. The young prince was christened with great
pomp, Charles Frederick. The emperor, Charles VI., was present
on the occasion, and in the solemnities there were blended
the most imposing civil, military, and ecclesiastical rites. The
baptism took place on the 31st of January, 1712, when the babe
was a week old. The young prince subsequently dropped the
name of Charles, and Frederick became his sole designation.
Wilhelmina, Frederick’s sister, was about three years older than
himself. We shall have frequent occasion to allude to her in the
course of this history, as between her and her brother there
sprang up a warm attachment, which was of life-long continuance.
Ten children were subsequently born to the royal pair,
making fourteen in all, most of whom attained mature years.</p>

<p>Frederick William, the Crown Prince, was at the time of the
birth of his son Frederick twenty-four years of age. He was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
very peculiar man, sturdy and thick-set in figure, of strong mental
powers, but quite uneducated. He was unpolished in manners,
rude in his address, honest and sincere, a stern, persevering
worker, despising all luxurious indulgence, and excessively devoted
to the routine of military duties.</p>

    <div class="caption">BAPTISM OF FREDERICK.</div></div>

<p>The king, Frederick I., had for some time been in a feeble state
of health. The burden of life had proved heavier than he was
able to bear. His wife was crazed, his home desolate, his health
broken, and many mortifications and disappointments had so
crushed his spirits that he had fallen into the deepest state of
melancholy. As he was sitting alone and sad in a chill morning
of February, 1713, gazing into the fire, absorbed in painful
musings, suddenly there was a crash of the glass door of the
apartment. His frenzied wife, half-clad, with disheveled hair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
having escaped from her keepers, came bursting through the
shattered panes. Her arms were gashed with glass, and she was
in the highest state of maniacal excitement. The shock proved
a death-blow to the infirm old king. He was carried to his bed,
which he never left, dying in a few days. His grandson Frederick
was then fourteen months old.</p>

<div id="ip_23" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.375em;">
  <img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="454" height="540" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">FREDERICK WILLIAM.</div></div>

<p>Frederick William was too stern a man to shed many tears
over his father’s death. The old king was ostentatious in his
tastes, fond of parade and splendor. The son had almost an insane
contempt for all court etiquette and all the elegancies of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
life. As he stood by his father’s dying bed, his unamiable, rugged
nature developed itself in the disgust, almost rage, with
which he regarded the courtly pageantry with which the expiring
monarch was surrounded. The remains of the king were allowed
to be conveyed to the tomb with that pomp which had
been dear to him while living.</p>

<p>But, immediately after these ceremonies were over, the new
monarch, who assumed the crown with the title of Frederick
William, not with that of Frederick II., to the utter consternation
of the court, dismissed nearly every honorary official of the
palace, from the highest dignitary to the humblest page. His
flashing eye and determined manner were so appalling that no
one ventured to remonstrate. A clean sweep was made, so that
the household was reduced to the lowest footing of economy consistent
with the supply of indispensable wants. Eight servants
were retained at six shillings a week. His father had thirty
pages; all were dismissed but three. There were one thousand
saddle-horses in the royal stables; Frederick William kept thirty.
Three fourths of the names were struck from the pension-list.
Thus rigidly the king went on through every department of administrative
and household expenses, until they were reduced to
below a fifth of what they had been under his father.</p>

<p>For twenty-seven years this strange man reigned. He was
like no other monarch. Great wisdom and shrewdness were
blended with unutterable folly and almost maniacal madness.
Though a man of strong powers of mind, he was very illiterate.
He certainly had some clear views of political economy. Carlyle
says of him, “His semi-articulate papers and rescripts on
these subjects are still almost worth reading by a lover of genuine
human talent in the dumb form. For spelling, grammar,
penmanship, and composition they resemble nothing else extant—are
as if done by the paw of a bear; indeed, the utterance generally
sounds more like the growling of a bear than any thing
that could be handily spelled or parsed. But there is a decisive
human sense in the heart of it; and there is such a dire hatred
of empty bladders, unrealities, and hypocritical forms and pretenses,
which he calls wind and humbug, as is very strange indeed.”</p>

<p>His energy inspired the whole kingdom, and paved the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
for the achievements of his son. The father created the machine
with which the son attained such wonderful results. He commuted
the old feudal service into a fixed money payment. He
goaded the whole realm into industry, compelling even the apple-women
to knit at the stalls. The crown lands were carefully
farmed out. He drained bogs, planted colonies, established
manufactures, and in every way encouraged the use of Prussian
products. He carried with him invariably a stout rattan cane.
Upon the slightest provocation, like a madman, he would thrash
those who displeased him. He was thoroughly an arbitrary
king, ruling at his sovereign will, and disposing of the liberty,
the property, and the lives of his subjects at his pleasure. Every
year he was accumulating large masses of coin, which he deposited
in barrels in the cellar of his palace. He had no powers of
graceful speech, but spent his energetic, joyless life in grumbling
and growling.</p>

<p>The Prussian minister, Baron Pöllnitz, in a letter from Berlin
dated June 6, 1729, writes: “The king’s prime minister is the
king himself, who is informed of every thing, and is desirous to
know every thing. He gives great application to business, but
does it with extraordinary ease; and nothing escapes his penetration
nor his memory, which is a very happy one. No sovereign
in the world is of more easy access, his subjects being actually
permitted to write to him without any other formality than
superscribing the letter <em>To the King</em>. By writing underneath,
<em>To be delivered into his Majesty’s own hands</em>, one may be sure
that the king receives and reads it, and that the next post he
will answer it, either with his own hands or by his secretary.
These answers are short, but peremptory. There is no town in
all the King of Prussia’s dominions, except Neufchatel, where he
has not been; no province which he does not know full well;
nor a court of justice but he is acquainted with its chief members.”</p>

<p>Fully conscious that the respect which would be paid to him
as a European sovereign greatly depended upon the number of
men he could bring into the field of battle, Frederick William
devoted untiring energies to the creation of an army. By the
most severe economy, watching with an eagle eye every expenditure,
and bringing his cudgel down mercilessly upon the shoulders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
of every loiterer, he succeeded in raising and maintaining
an army of one hundred thousand men; seventy-two thousand
being field troops, and thirty thousand in garrison.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> He drilled
these troops as troops were never drilled before.</p>

<p>Regardless himself of comfort, insensible to fatigue, dead to
affection, he created perhaps the most potent military machine
earth has ever known. Prussia was an armed camp. The king
prized his soldiers as a miser prizes his gold coin, and was as unwilling
to expose them to any danger as the miser is to hazard
his treasures. War would thin his regiments, soil his uniforms,
destroy his <em>materiel</em>. He hated war. But his army caused Prussia
to be respected. If needful, he could throw one hundred
thousand of the best drilled and best furnished troops in Europe,
like a thunderbolt, upon any point. Unprincipled monarchs
would think twice before they would encroach upon a man
thus armed.</p>

<p>There was but one short war in which Frederick William engaged
during his reign of twenty-seven years. That was with
Charles XII. of Sweden. It lasted but a few months, and from
it the Prussian king returned victorious. The demands of Frederick
William were not unreasonable. As he commenced the
brief campaign, which began and ended with the siege of Stralsund,
he said: “Why will the very king whom I most respect
compel me to be his enemy?” In his characteristic farewell order
to his ministers, he wrote: “My wife shall be told of all
things, and counsel asked of her. And as I am a man, and may
be shot dead, I command you and all to take care of Fritz, as God
shall reward you. And I give you all, wife to begin with, my
curse that God may punish you in time and eternity if you do
not, after my death, bury me in the vault of the palace church
at Berlin. And you shall make no grand to-do on the occasion.
On your body and life no festivals and ceremonials, except that
the regiments, one after the other, fire a volley over me. I am
assured that you will manage every thing with all the exactness
in the world, for which I shall ever, zealously, as long as I live,
be your friend.”</p>

<p>The king was scrupulously clean, washing five times a day.
He would allow no drapery, no stuffed furniture, no carpets in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
his apartments. They caught dust. He sat upon a plain wooden
chair. He ate roughly, like a farmer, of roast beef, despising
all delicacies. His almost invariable dress was a close military
blue coat, with red cuffs and collar, buff waistcoat and breeches,
and white linen gaiters to the knee. A sword was belted around
his loins, and, as we have said, a stout rattan or bamboo cane
ever in his hand. A well-worn, battered, triangular hat covered
his head. He walked rapidly through the streets which surrounded
his palaces at Potsdam and Berlin. If he met any one
who attracted his attention, male or female, he would abruptly,
menacingly inquire, “Who are you?” A street-lounger he has
been known to hit over the head with his cane, exclaiming,
“Home, you rascal, and go to work.” If any one prevaricated
or hesitated, he would sternly demand, “Look me in the face.”
If there were still hesitancy, or the king were dissatisfied with
the answers, the one interrogated was lucky if he escaped without
a caning.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>The boorish king hated the refinement and polish of the French.
If he met a lady in rich attire, she was pretty sure to be rudely
assailed; and a young man fashionably dressed could hardly escape
the cudgel if he came within reach of the king’s arm. The
king, stalking through the streets, was as marked an object as an
elephant would have been. Every one instantly recognized him,
and many fled at his approach. One day he met a pale, threadbare
young man, who was quietly passing him, when the king
stopped, in his jerking gait, and demanded, in his coarse, rapid
utterance, “Who are you?” “I am a theological student,” the
young man quietly replied. “Where from?” added the king.
“From Berlin,” was the response. “From Berlin?” the king rejoined;
“the Berliners are all a good-for-nothing set.” “Yes,
your majesty, that is true of many of them,” the young man added;
“but I know of two exceptions.” “Of two?” responded the
king; “which are they?” “Your majesty and myself,” the young
man replied. The king burst into a good-humored laugh, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
after having the young man carefully examined, assigned him to
a chaplaincy.</p>

<p>The French minister at the court of Berlin, Count Rothenburg,
was a Prussian by birth. He was a man of much diplomatic
ability, and a very accomplished gentleman. Having spent
much of his life in Paris, he had acquired the polished manners
of the French court, and wore the costume appropriate to the
Tuileries and Versailles. He and his associates in the embassy
attracted much attention as they appeared in their cocked hats,
flowing wigs, laced coats, and other gorgeous trimmings. The
king, in his homespun garb, was apprehensive that the example
so obnoxious to him might spread.</p>

<p>There was to be a grand review on the parade-ground just out
from Berlin, at which the French embassy was to be present.
The king caused a party equal in number, composed of the lowest
of the people, to be dressed in an enormous exaggeration of
the French costume. Their cocked hats were nearly a yard in
diameter. Immense wigs reached to their heels; and all other
parts of the French court costume were caricatured in the most
grotesque manner possible. As soon as the French embassy appeared,
there was a great sound of trumpets and martial bands
from another part of the field, and these harlequins were brought
forward to the gaze of every eye, and conspicuously to the view
of Count Rothenburg and his companions. Military discipline
prevented any outburst of derisive laughter. Perfect silence
reigned. The king sat upon his horse as stolid and grim as fate.
Count Rothenburg yielded to this gross discourtesy of the king,
and ever after, while he remained in Berlin, wore a plain German
costume.</p>

<p>Frederick William was very anxious that little Fritz should
be trained to warlike tastes and habits; that, like himself, he
should scorn all effeminacy; that, wearing homespun clothes,
eating frugal food, despising all pursuits of pleasure and all literary
tastes, he should be every inch a soldier. But, to the bitter
disappointment of the father, the child manifested no taste
for soldiering. He was gentle, affectionate, fond of books and
music,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> and with an almost feminine love clung to his sister. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
stern old king was not only disappointed, but angered. These
were qualities which he deemed unmanly, and which he thoroughly
despised.</p>

    <div class="caption">THE LITTLE DRUMMER.</div></div>

<p>One day the father, returning home, found, to his inexpressible
delight, little Fritz strutting about beating a drum, with Wilhelmina
marching by his side. The king could scarcely restrain his
joy. At last the military element was being developed in his
child. He hastened with the tidings to his wife, whom he called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
by the pet name of “Phiekin”—a word apparently coined from
Sophie. The matter was talked about all over the palace. A
painter was sent for to transfer the scene to canvas. This picture,
greatly admired, still hangs upon the walls of the Charlottenburg
palace. Of this picture Carlyle writes: “Fritz is still,
if not in ‘long-clothes,’ at least in longish and flowing clothes of
the petticoat sort, which look as of dark blue velvet, very simple,
pretty, and appropriate; in a cap of the same; has a short raven’s
feather in the cap, and looks up with a face and eyes full
of beautiful vivacity and child’s enthusiasm, one of the beautifulest
little figures, while the little drum responds to his bits of
drumsticks. Sister Wilhelmina, taller by some three years, looks
on in pretty stooping attitude, and with a graver smile. Blackamoor
and room-furniture elegant enough; and finally the figure
of a grenadier on guard, seen far off through an open window,
make up the background.”</p>

<p>The early governess of little Fritz was a French lady of much
refinement and culture, Madame Racoule. She was in entire
sympathy with her pupil. Their tastes were in harmony. Fritz
became as familiar with the French language as if it were his
mother tongue. Probably through her influence he acquired
that fondness for French literature and that taste for French elegance
which continued with him through life.</p>

<p>When the child was but six years of age his father organized
a miniature soldiers’ company for him, consisting of one hundred
lads. Gradually the number was increased to three hundred.
The band was called “The Crown Prince Cadets.” A very spirited,
mature boy of seventeen, named Rentzel, was drill-sergeant,
while an experienced colonel was appointed commander-in-chief.
Fritz was very thoroughly instructed in his duties, and was furnished
with a military dress, almost the fac-simile of that which
his father wore. An arsenal was also provided for the child on
the palace grounds at Potsdam, where he mounted batteries and
practiced gunnery with small brass ordnance. Nothing was
omitted which could inspire the prince with military enthusiasm,
and render him skillful in the art of war. A Prussian gentleman
of letters testifies as follows respecting Fritz in his seventh year:</p>

<p>“The Crown Prince manifests in this tender age an uncommon
capacity, nay, we may say, something quite extraordinary. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
is a most alert and vivacious prince. He has fine and sprightly
manners, and shows a certain kindly sociality and so affectionate
a disposition that all things may be hoped of him. The
French lady who has had charge of him hitherto can not speak
of him without enthusiasm. ‘He is a little angel,’ she is wont
to say. He takes up and learns whatever is placed before him
with the greatest facility.”</p>

<div id="ip_31" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20.3125em;">
  <img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="325" height="344" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">THE ARSENAL.</div></div>

<p>When Fritz was seven years of age, he was taken from the
care of his female teachers and placed under tutors who had been
carefully selected for him. They were all military officers who
had won renown on fields of blood. The first of these was M.
Duhan, a French gentleman of good birth and acquirements. He
was but thirty years of age. By his accomplishments he won
the esteem, and by his amiability the love, of his pupil. Count
Finkenstein, the second, was a veteran general, sixty years old,
who also secured the affections of little Fritz. Colonel Kalkstein
was twenty-eight years of age. He was a thorough soldier
and a man of honor. For forty years, until his death, he retained
the regards of his pupil, who was ever accustomed to speak of
him as “my master Kalkstein.” In the education of the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
prince every thing was conducted in accordance with the most
inflexible routine. From the minute directions given to the
teachers in a document drawn up by the father, bunglingly expressed
and wretchedly spelled, we cull out the following:</p>

<p>“My son must be impressed with love and fear of God, as the
foundation of our temporal and eternal welfare. No false religions
or sects of Atheist, Arian, Socinian, or whatever name the
poisonous things have, which can so easily corrupt a young mind,
are to be even named in his hearing. He is to be taught a proper
abhorrence of papistry, and to be shown its baselessness and
nonsensicality. Impress on him the true religion, which consists
essentially in this, that Christ died for all men. He is to learn
no Latin, but French and German, so as to speak and write with
brevity and propriety.</p>

<p>“Let him learn arithmetic, mathematics, artillery, economy, to
the very bottom; history in particular; ancient history only
slightly, but the history of the last hundred and fifty years to
the exactest pitch. He must be completely master of geography,
as also of whatever is remarkable in each country. With increasing
years you will more and more, to an especial degree, go
upon fortification, the formation of a camp, and other war sciences,
that the prince may, from youth upward, be trained to act
as officer and general, and to seek all his glory in the soldier
profession. You have, in the highest measure, to make it your
care to infuse into my son a true love for the soldier business,
and to impress on him that, as there is nothing in the world
which can bring a prince renown and honor like the sword, so
he would be a despised creature before all men if he did not
love it and seek his glory therein.”</p>

<p>In October, 1723, when the prince was eleven years of age, his
grandfather, George I., came to Berlin to visit his daughter and
his son-in-law, the mother and father of Fritz. From the windows
of his apartment he looked out with much interest upon
Fritz, drilling his cadet company upon the esplanade in front of
the palace. The clock-work precision of the movements of the
boy soldiers greatly surprised him.</p>

<p>Every year Frederick William rigorously reviewed all his garrisons.
Though accompanied by a numerous staff, he traveled
with Spartan simplicity, regardless of exposure and fatigue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
From an early age he took Fritz with him on these annual reviews.
A common vehicle, called the sausage car, and which
was the most primitive of carriages, was often used by the king
in his rough travels and hunting excursions. This consisted of
a mere stuffed pole, some ten or twelve feet long, upon which one
sits astride, as if riding a rail. It rested upon wheels, probably
with a sort of stirrup for the feet, and the riders, ten or a dozen,
were rattled along over the rough roads, through dust or mud,
alike regardless of winter’s frost or summer’s rain. The cast-iron
king, rejoicing in hardship and exposure, robbed his delicate
child even of needful sleep, saying, “Too much sleep stupefies
a fellow.”</p>

<div id="ip_33" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27.875em;">
  <img src="images/i_033.jpg" width="446" height="344" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">THE SAUSAGE CAR.</div></div>

<p>This rude, coarse discipline was thoroughly uncongenial to the
Crown Prince. He was a boy of delicate feelings and sensitive
temperament. The poetic nature very decidedly predominated
in him. He was fond of music, played the flute, wrote verses,
and was literary in his tastes. He simply hated chasing boars,
riding on the sausage car, and being drenched with rain and
spattered with mud. The old king, a mere animal with an active
intellect, could not appreciate, could not understand even, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
delicate mental and physical organization of his child. It is interesting
to observe how early in life these constitutional characteristics
will develop themselves, and how unavailing are all
the efforts of education entirely to obliterate them. When Frederick
William was a boy, he received, as a present, a truly magnificent
dressing-gown, of graceful French fashion, richly embroidered
with gold. Indignantly he thrust the robe into the
fire, declaring that he would wear no such finery, and demanded
instead a jacket of wholesome homespun. Fritz, on the contrary,
could not endure the coarse homespun, but, with almost girlish
fondness, craved handsome dress. He had no money allowance
until he was seventeen years of age. A minute account was
kept of every penny expended for him, and the most rigid economy
was practiced in providing him with the mere necessaries
of life. When Fritz was in the tenth year of his age, his father
gave the following curious directions to the three teachers of his
son in reference to his daily mode of life. The document, an
abridgment of which we give, was dated Wusterhausen, September
3, 1721:</p>

<p>“On Sunday he is to rise at seven o’clock, and, as soon as he
has got his slippers on, shall kneel at his bedside and pray to
God, so as all in the room may hear, in these words:</p>

<p>“‘Lord God, blessed Father, I thank thee from my heart that
thou hast so graciously preserved me through this night. Fit
me for what thy holy will is, and grant that I do nothing this
day, nor all the days of my life, which can divide me from thee;
for the Lord Jesus my Redeemer’s sake. Amen.’</p>

<p>“After which the Lord’s Prayer; then rapidly and vigorously
wash himself clean; dress, and powder, and comb himself.
While they are combing and queuing him, he is to breakfast on
tea. Prayer, washing, breakfast, and the rest to be done pointedly
within fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>“This finished, his domestics and preceptor, Duhan, shall come
in and perform family worship. Prayer on their knees. Duhan
to read a chapter of the Bible, and sing some proper psalm or
hymn. All the domestics then withdraw, and Duhan reads my
son the Gospel of the Sunday, expounds it a little, adducing the
main points of Christianity, and questioning him from Noltenius’s
Catechism. It will then be nine o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
“At nine o’clock he brings my son down to me, who goes to
church and dines with me at twelve o’clock. The rest of the
day is his own. At half past nine in the evening he shall come
and bid me good-night; shall then go directly to his room; very
rapidly get off his clothes, wash his hands, and, as soon as that
is done, Duhan shall make a prayer on his knees and sing a hymn,
all the servants being there again. Instantly after which my
son shall get into bed; shall be <em>in</em> bed at half past ten.</p>

<p>“On Monday, as on all week-days, he is to be called at six
o’clock, and so soon as he is called he is to rise. You are to
stand by him that he do not loiter or turn in bed, but briskly
and at once get up and say his prayers the same as on Sunday
morning. This done, he shall, as rapidly as he can, get on his
shoes and spatterdashes, also wash his face and hands, but not
with soap; shall put on his dressing-gown, have his hair combed
and queued, but not powdered. While being combed and queued,
he shall, at the same time, take breakfast of tea, so that both jobs
go on at once; and all this shall be ended before half past six.
Preceptor and domestics shall then come in with Bible and
hymn-books, and have family worship as on Sunday. This shall
be done by seven o’clock.</p>

<p>“From seven till nine Duhan takes him on history; at nine
o’clock comes Noltenius” (a clergyman from Berlin) “with the
Christian religion till a quarter to eleven. Then Fritz rapidly
washes his face with water, his hands with soap and water; clean
shirt; powders and puts on his coat. At eleven o’clock he comes
to the king, dines with him at twelve, and stays till two.</p>

<p>“Directly at two he goes back to his room. Duhan is then
ready; takes him upon maps and geography from two to three
o’clock, giving account of all the European kingdoms, their
strength and weakness; the size, riches, and poverty of their
towns. From three o’clock till four Duhan shall treat of morality;
from four till five shall write German letters with him, and
see that he gets a good style. About five o’clock Fritz shall
wash his hands and go to the king; ride out, and divert himself
in the air, and not in his room, and do what he likes if it is not
against God.”</p>

<p>Thus the employments of every hour were strictly specified
for every day in the week. On Wednesday he had a partial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
holiday. After half past nine, having finished his history and
“got something by heart to strengthen the memory, Fritz shall
rapidly dress himself and come to the king, and the rest of the
day belongs to little Fritz.” On Saturday he was to be reviewed
in all the studies of the week, “to see whether he has profited.
General Finkenstein and Colonel Kalkstein shall be present during
this. If Fritz has profited, the afternoon shall be his own.
If he has not profited, he shall from two o’clock till six repeat
and learn rightly what he has forgotten on the past days. In
undressing and dressing, you must accustom him to get out of
and into his clothes as fast as is humanly possible. You will
also look that he learn to put on and put off his clothes himself,
without help from others, and that he be clean, and neat, and not
so dirty.”</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">Wusterhausen,</span> where the young Crown Prince spent many
of these early years of his life, was a rural retreat of the king
about twenty miles southeast from Berlin. The palace consisted
of a plain, unornamented, rectangular pile, surrounded by numerous
outbuildings, and rising from the midst of low and swampy
grounds tangled with thickets and interspersed with fish-pools.
Game of all kinds abounded in those lakelets, sluggish streams,
and jungles.</p>

<p>In the court-yard there was a fountain with stone steps, where
Frederick William loved to sit on summer evenings and smoke
his pipe. He frequently took his frugal dinner here in the open
air under a lime-tree, with the additional protection of an awning.
After dinner he would throw himself down for a nap on a
wooden bench, apparently regardless of the flaming sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
There seems to have been but little which was attractive
about this castle. It was surrounded by a moat, which Wilhelmina
describes as a “black, abominable ditch.” Its pets were
shrieking eagles, and two black bears ugly and vicious. Its interior
accommodations were at the farthest possible remove from
luxurious indulgence. “It was a dreadfully crowded place,”
says Wilhelmina, “where you are stuffed into garrets and have
not room to turn.”</p>

<p>Still Wusterhausen was but a hunting-lodge, which was occupied
by the king only during a few weeks in the autumn. Fritz
had many playmates—his brothers and sisters, his cousins, and
the children of General Finkenstein. To most boys, the streams,
and groves, and ponds of Wusterhausen, abounding with fish and
all kinds of game, with ponies to drive and boats to row, with
picturesque walks and drives, would have been full of charms.
But the tastes of Fritz did not lie in that direction. He does
not seem to have become strongly attached to any of his young
companions, except to his sister Wilhelmina. The affection and
confidence which united their hearts were truly beautiful. They
encountered together some of the severest of life’s trials, but
heartfelt sympathy united them. The nickname which these
children gave their unamiable father was <em>Stumpy</em>.</p>

<p>There were other abodes of the king, the Berlin and Potsdam
palaces, which retained much of the splendor with which they
had been embellished by the splendor-loving monarch, Frederick
I. There were but few regal mansions in the world which then
surpassed them. And though the king furnished his own apartments
with Spartan simplicity and rudeness, there were other
portions of these royal residences, as also their surroundings in
general, which were magnificent in the highest degree. The
health of little Fritz was rather frail, and at times he found it
hard to devote himself to his sturdy tasks with the energy which
his father required.</p>

<p>Though Fritz wrote a legible business hand, was well instructed
in most points of useful knowledge, and had a very decided
taste for elegant literature, he never attained correctness in spelling.
The father was bitterly opposed to Latin. Perhaps it was
the prohibition which inspired the son with an intense desire to
learn that language. He took secret lessons. His vigilant father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
caught him in the very act, with dictionary and grammar,
and a teacher by his side. The infuriated king, volleying forth
his rage, would have caned the teacher had he not in terror fled.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>The king soon learned, to his inexpressible displeasure and
mortification, that his boy was not soldierly in his tastes; that he
did not love the rude adventures of the chase, or the exposure
and hardships which a martial life demands. He had caught
Fritz playing the flute, and even writing verses. He saw that
he was fond of graceful attire, and that he was disposed to dress
his hair in the French fashion. He was a remarkably handsome
boy, of fine figure, with a lady’s hand and foot, and soft blonde
locks carefully combed. All this the king despised. Scornfully
and indignantly he exclaimed, “My son is a flute-player and a
poet!” In his vexation he summoned Fritz to his presence, called
in the barber, and ordered his flowing locks to be cut off,
cropped, and soaped in the most rigid style of military cut.</p>

<p>The father was now rapidly forming a strong dislike to the
character of his son. In nothing were they in harmony. Five
princesses had been born, sisters of Fritz. At last another son
was born, Augustus William, ten years younger than Frederick.
The king turned his eyes to him, hoping that he would be more
in sympathy with the paternal heart. His dislike for Fritz grew
continually more implacable, until it assumed the aspect of bitter
hatred.</p>

<p>Sophie Dorothee tenderly loved her little Fritz, and, with a
mother’s fondness, endeavored to shield him, in every way in her
power, from his father’s brutality. Wilhelmina also clung to
her brother with devotion which nothing could disturb. Thus
both mother and daughter incurred in some degree the hatred
with which the father regarded his son. It will be remembered
that the mother of Fritz was daughter of George I. of England.
Her brother subsequently became George II. He had a son,
Fred, about the age of Wilhelmina, and a daughter, Amelia, six
months older than Fritz. The mother, Sophie Dorothee, had set
her heart upon a double marriage—of Wilhelmina with Fred,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
and of Fritz with Amelia. But many obstacles arose in the
way of these nuptials.</p>

<div id="ip_39" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25.3125em;">
  <img src="images/i_039.jpg" width="405" height="479" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">MAKING A SOLDIER OF HIM.</div></div>

<p>George was a taciturn, jealous, sullen old man, who quarreled
with his son, who was then Prince of Wales. The other powers
of Europe were decidedly opposed to this double marriage,
as it would, in their view, create too intimate a union between
Prussia and England, making them virtually one. Frederick
William also vexatiously threw hinderances in the way. But
the heart of the loving mother, Sophie Dorothee, was fixed upon
these nuptials. For years she left no efforts of diplomacy or intrigue
untried to accomplish her end. George I. is represented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
by Horace Walpole as a stolid, stubborn old German, living in
a cloud of tobacco-smoke, and stupefying his faculties with beer.
He had in some way formed a very unfavorable opinion of Wilhelmina,
considering her, very falsely, ungainly in person and
fretful in disposition. But at last the tact of Sophie Dorothee
so far prevailed over her father, the British king, that he gave
his somewhat reluctant but positive consent to the double matrimonial
alliance. This was in 1723. Wilhelmina was then
fourteen years of age. Fritz, but eleven years old, was too young
to think very deeply upon the subject of his marriage. The
young English Fred bore at that time the title of the Duke of
Gloucester. He soon sent an envoy to Prussia, probably to convey
to his intended bride presents and messages of love. The
interview took place in the palace of Charlottenburg, a few miles
out from Berlin. The vivacious Wilhelmina, in the following
terms, describes the interview in her journal:</p>

<p>“There came, in those weeks, one of the Duke of Gloucester’s
gentlemen to Berlin. The queen had a soiree. He was presented
to her as well as to me. He made a very obliging compliment
on his master’s part. I blushed and answered only by a
courtesy. The queen, who had her eye on me, was very angry
that I had answered the duke’s compliments in mere silence, and
rated me sharply for it, and ordered me, under pain of her indignation,
to repair that fault to-morrow. I retired all in tears to
my room, exasperated against the queen and against the duke.
I vowed I would never marry him.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile the King of England’s time of arrival was drawing
nigh. We repaired on the 6th of October to Charlottenburg
to receive him. My heart kept beating. I was in cruel agitations.
King George arrived on the 8th about seven in the evening.
The King of Prussia, the queen, and all their suite received
him in the court of the palace, the apartments being on the
ground floor. So soon as he had saluted the king and queen I
was presented to him. He embraced me, and, turning to the
queen, said, ‘Your daughter is very large of her age.’ He gave
the queen his hand and led her into her apartment, whither every
body followed them. As soon as I came in he took a light
from the table and surveyed me from head to foot. I stood motionless
as a statue, and was much put out of countenance. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
this went on without his uttering the least word. Having thus
passed me in review, he addressed himself to my brother, whom
he caressed much and amused himself with for a good while.</p>

<p>“The queen made me a sign to follow her, and passed into a
neighboring apartment, where she had the English and Germans
of King George’s suite successively presented to her. After some
talk with these gentlemen she withdrew, leaving me to entertain
them, and saying, ‘Speak English to my daughter; you will
find she speaks it very well.’ I felt much less embarrassed when
the queen was gone, and, picking up a little courage, entered into
conversation with these English. As I spoke their language like
my mother tongue I got pretty well out of the affair, and every
body seemed charmed with me. They made my eulogy to the
queen; told her I had quite the English air, and was made to
be their sovereign one day. It was saying a great deal on their
part; for these English think themselves so much above all other
people that they imagine that they are paying a high compliment
when they tell any one he has got English manners.</p>

<p>“Their king” (Wilhelmina’s grandfather) “was of extreme
gravity, and hardly spoke a word to any body. He saluted
Madam Sonsfeld, my governess, very coldly, and asked if I was
always so serious, and if my humor was of a melancholy turn.
‘Any thing but that, sire,’ answered Madam Sonsfeld; ‘but the
respect she has for your majesty prevents her from being as
sprightly as she commonly is.’ He shook his head and said nothing.
The reception he had given me, and this question, gave me
such a chill that I never had the courage to speak to him.”</p>

<p>The wife of George I., the mother of Sophie Dorothee, was the
subject of one of the saddest of earthly tragedies. Her case is
still involved in some obscurity. She was a beautiful, haughty,
passionate princess of Zelle when she married her cousin George,
Elector of Hanover. George became jealous of Count Königsmark,
a very handsome courtier of commanding address. In an
angry altercation with his wife, it is said that the infuriate husband
boxed her ears. Suddenly, on the 1st of July, 1694, Count
Königsmark disappeared. Mysteriously he vanished from earth,
and was heard of no more. The unhappy wife, who had given
birth to the daughter Sophie Dorothee, bearing her mother’s
name, and to a son, afterward George II., almost frenzied with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
rage, was divorced from her husband, and was locked up in the
gloomy castle of Ahlden, situated in the solitary moors of Luneburg
heath. Here she was held in captivity for thirty years,
until she died. In the mean time, George, ascending the throne
of England, solaced himself in the society of female favorites,
none of whom he honored with the title of wife. The raging
captive of Ahlden, who seems never to have become submissive
to her lot, could, of course, exert no influence in the marriage of
her grandchildren.</p>

<p>Wilhelmina says that her grandpapa George was intolerably
proud after he had attained the dignity of King of England, and
that he was much disposed to look down upon her father, the
King of Prussia, as occupying a very inferior position. Vexatiously
he delayed signing the marriage treaty, to which he had
given a verbal assent, evading the subject and presenting frivolous
excuses. The reputation of the English Fred was far from
good. He had attained eighteen years of age, was very unattractive
in personal appearance, and extremely dissolute. George
I., morose and moody, was only rendered more obstinate by being
pressed. These delays exasperated Frederick William, who
was far from being the meekest of men. Poor Sophie Dorothee
was annoyed almost beyond endurance. Wilhelmina took
the matter very coolly, for she declared that she cared nothing
about her cousin Fred, and that she had no wish to marry
him.</p>

<p>The months rolled rapidly on, and Fritz, having entered his
fourteenth year, was appointed by his father, in May, 1725, captain
in the Potsdam Grenadier Guard. This giant regiment has
attained world-wide renown, solely from the peculiarity of its organization.
Such a body of men never existed before, never will
again. It was one of the singular freaks of the Prussian king to
form a grenadier guard of men of gigantic stature. In the prosecution
of this senseless aim not only his own realms were ransacked,
but Europe and even Asia was explored in search of giants.
The army was with Frederick William the great object
of life, and the giant guard was the soul of the army. This guard
consisted of three battalions, 800 in each, 2400 in all. The shortest
of the men were nearly seven feet high. The tallest were
almost nine feet in height. They had been gathered, at an enormous
expense, out of every country where they could be found.
No greater favor could be conferred upon the king than to obtain
for him a giant. Many amusing anecdotes are related of
the stratagems to which the king resorted to obtain these mammoth
soldiers. Portraits were painted of all of them. Frederick
William paid very little regard to individual rights or to the
law of nations if any chance presented itself by which he could
seize upon one of these monster men. Reigning in absolutism,
compared with which the despotism of Turkey is mild, if he
found in his domains any young woman of remarkable stature,
he would compel her to marry one of his giants. It does not,
however, appear that he thus succeeded in perpetuating a gigantic
race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
Prussian recruiters were sent in all directions to search with
eagle eyes for candidates for the Potsdam Guard. Their pay
was higher than that of any other troops, and they enjoyed unusual
privileges. Their drill and discipline were as perfect as
could by any possibility be achieved. The following stories are
apparently well-authenticated, describing the means to which
the king often resorted to obtain these men.</p>

<p>In the town of Zulich there was a very tall young carpenter
by the name of Zimmerman. A Prussian recruiting officer, in
disguise, Baron von Hompesch, entered the shop and ordered a
stout chest to be made, “six feet six inches in length, at least—at
all events, longer than yourself, Mr. Zimmerman. Mind you,”
he added, “if too short it will be of no service to me.” At the
appointed time he called for the chest. Looking at it, he exclaimed,
in apparent disappointment, “Too short, as I dreaded!”
“I am certain it is over six feet six,” said the carpenter, taking
out his rule. “But I said that it was to be longer than yourself,”
was the reply. “Well, it is,” rejoined the carpenter. To prove
it, he jumped into the chest. Hompesch slammed down the lid,
locked it, whistled, and three stout fellows came in, who shouldered
the chest and carried it through the streets to a remote
place outside of the town. Here the chest was opened, and poor
Zimmerman was found dead, stifled to death.</p>

<p>On another occasion, an Austrian gentleman, M. Von Bentenrieder,
who was exceedingly tall, was journeying from Vienna to
Berlin as the embassador from the Emperor Charles VI. to the
Congress of Cambrai. When near Halberstadt some part of his
carriage broke. While the smith was repairing it, M. Bentenrieder
walked on. He passed a Prussian guard-house, alone, in
plain clothes, on foot, an immensely tall, well-formed man. It
was too rich a prize to be lost. The officials seized him, and
hurried him into the guard-house. But soon his carriage came
along with his suite. He was obsequiously hailed as “Your
Excellency.” The recruiting officers of Frederick William, mortified
and chagrined, with many apologies released the embassador
of the emperor.</p>

<p>As we have mentioned, the agents of the King of Prussia were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
eager to kidnap tall men, in whatever country they could find
them. This greatly exasperated the rulers of the various realms
of all sizes and conditions which surrounded the Prussian territory.
Frederick William was always ready to apologize, and to
aver that each individual act was done without his orders or
knowledge. Still, there was no abatement of this nuisance.
Several seizures had been made in Hanover, which was the hereditary
domain of George I., King of England. George was
very angry. He was increasingly obstinate in withholding his
assent to the double marriage, and even, by way of reprisal,
seized several of the subjects of Frederick William, whom he
caught in Hanover.</p>

<p>Sophie Dorothee seemed to have but one thought—the double
marriage. This would make Wilhelmina queen of England, and
would give her dear son Frederick an English princess for his
bride. Her efforts, embarrassments, disappointments, were endless.
Frederick William began to be regarded by the other
powers as a very formidable man, whose alliance was exceedingly
desirable. His army, of sixty thousand men, rapidly increasing,
was as perfect in drill and discipline as ever existed. It
was thoroughly furnished with all the appliances of war. The
king himself, living in Spartan simplicity, and cutting down the
expenses of his court to the lowest possible figure, was consecrating
the resources of his realm to the promotion of its physical
strength, and was accumulating iron-bound casks of gold and silver
coin in the cellars of his palace. It became a matter of much
moment to every court in Europe whether such a monarch
should be its enemy or its ally.</p>

<p>After a long series of intrigues, a narrative of which would not
interest the reader, Frederick William was induced to enter into
an alliance, offensive and defensive, with the Emperor Charles
VI. of Germany. This was renouncing the alliance with England,
and threw an additional obstacle in the way of the double
marriage. Sophie Dorothee was bitterly disappointed, and
yet pertinaciously struggled on to accomplish her end.</p>

<p>There was an institution, if we may so call it, in the palace of
the King of Prussia which became greatly renowned, and which
was denominated “The Tobacco College,” or “Tobacco Parliament.”
It consisted simply of a smoking-room very plainly furnished,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
where the king and about a dozen of his confidential advisers
met to smoke and to talk over, with perfect freedom and
informality, affairs of state. Carlyle thus quaintly describes this
<em>Tabagie</em>:</p>

<div id="ip_46" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.25em;">
  <img src="images/i_046.jpg" width="452" height="349" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">THE TOBACCO PARLIAMENT.</div></div>

<p>“Any room that was large enough, and had height of ceiling
and air circulation, and no cloth furniture, would do. And in
each palace is one, or more than one, that has been fixed upon
and fitted out for that object. A high room, as the engravings
give it us; contented, saturnine human figures, a dozen or so
of them, sitting around a large, long table furnished for the occasion;
a long Dutch pipe in the mouth of each man; supplies of
knaster easily accessible; small pan of burning peat, in the Dutch
fashion (sandy native charcoal, which burns slowly without
smoke), is at your left hand; at your right a jug, which I find to
consist of excellent, thin, bitter beer; other costlier materials for
drinking, if you want such, are not beyond reach. On side-tables
stand wholesome cold meats, royal rounds of beef not wanting,
with bread thinly sliced and buttered; in a rustic, but neat
and abundant way, such innocent accommodations, narcotic or
nutritious, gaseous, fluid, and solid, as human nature can require.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
Perfect equality is the rule; no rising or no notice taken when
any body enters or leaves. Let the entering man take his place
and pipe without obligatory remarks. If he can not smoke, let
him at least affect to do so, and not ruffle the established stream
of things. And so puff, slowly puff! and any comfortable speech
that is in you, or none, if you authentically have not any.”</p>

<p>Distinguished strangers were often admitted to the <em>Tabagie</em>.
The Crown Prince Fritz was occasionally present, though always
reluctantly. The other children of this numerous family not
unfrequently came in to bid papa good-night. Here every thing
was talked of, with entire freedom, all court gossip, the adventures
of the chase, diplomacy, and the administrative measures
of the government. Frederick William had but very little respect
for academic culture. He had scarcely the slightest acquaintance
with books, and gathered around him mainly men
whose knowledge was gained in the practical employments of
life. It would seem, from many well-authenticated anecdotes,
which have come down to us from the <em>Tabagie</em>, that these
smoking companions of the king, like Frederick William himself,
must have been generally a coarse set of men.</p>

<p>One of this smoking cabinet was a celebrated adventurer
named Gundling, endowed with wonderful encyclopedian knowledge,
and an incorrigible drunkard. He had been every where,
seen every thing, and remembered all which he had either heard
or seen. Frederick William had accidentally picked him up,
and, taking a fancy to him, had clothed him, pensioned him, and
introduced him to his Tabagie, where his peculiar character often
made him the butt of ridicule. He was excessively vain,
wore a scarlet coat, and all manner of pranks were cut up by
these boon companions, in the midst of their cups, at his expense.</p>

<p>Another adventurer, by the name of Fassman, who had written
books, and who made much literary pretension, had come to
Berlin and also got introduced to the Tabagie. He was in character
very like Gundling, and the two could never agree. Fassman
could be very sarcastic and bitter in his speech. One evening,
as the king and his smoking cabinet were sitting enveloped
in the clouds which they were breathing forth, and were all
muddled with tobacco and beer—for the king himself was a
hard drinker—Fassman so enraged Gundling by some cutting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
remarks, that the latter seized his pan of burning peat and red-hot
sand and dashed it into the face of his antagonist. Fassman,
who was much the more powerful of the two, was seriously
burned. He instantly grasped his antagonist, dragged him
down, and beat him savagely with his hot pan, amidst roars of
laughter from the beer-stupefied bacchanals.</p>

<p>The half-intoxicated king gravely suggests that such conduct
is hardly seemly among gentlemen; that the duel is the more
chivalric way of settling such difficulties. Fassman challenges
Gundling. They meet with pistols. It is understood by the
seconds that it is to be rather a Pickwickian encounter. The
trembling Gundling, when he sees his antagonist before him,
with the deadly weapon in his hand, throws his pistol away,
which his considerate friends had harmlessly loaded with powder
only, declaring that he would not shoot any man, or have
any man shoot him. Fassman sternly advances with his harmless
pistol, and shoots the powder into Gundling’s wig. It
blazes into a flame. With a shriek Gundling falls to the ground
as if dead. A bucket of water extinguishes the flames, and
roars of laughter echo over the chivalric field of combat.</p>

<p>Such was the Tobacco Parliament in its trivial aspects. But
it had also its serious functions. Many questions were discussed
there which stirred men’s souls, and which roused the ambition
or the wrath of the stern old king to the utmost pitch.</p>

<p>We have now reached the year 1726. The Emperor of Germany
declares that he can never give his consent to the double
marriage with the English princes. Frederick William, who is
not at all fond of his wife’s relatives, and is annoyed by the hesitancy
which his father-in-law has manifested in reference to it,
is also turning his obstinate will against the nuptial alliance.
A more imperative and inflexible man never breathed. This
year the unhappy wife of George I. died, unreconciled, wretched,
exasperated, after thirty years’ captivity in the castle of Ahlden.
Darker and darker seemed the gloom which enveloped the path
of Sophie Dorothee. She still clung to the marriages as the
dearest hope of her heart. It was with her an ever-present
thought. But Frederick William was the most obdurate and
obstinate of mortals.</p>

<p>“The wide, overarching sky,” writes Carlyle, “looks down on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
no more inflexible sovereign man than him, in the red-collared
blue coat and white leggins, with the bamboo in his hand; a
peaceable, capacious, not ill-given sovereign man, if you will let
him have his way; but to bar his way, to tweak the nose of his
sovereign royalty, and ignominiously force <em>him</em> into another way,
that is an enterprise no man or devil, or body of men or devils,
need attempt. The first step in such an attempt will require to
be the assassination of Frederick Wilhelm, for you may depend
upon it, royal Sophie, so long as he is alive the feat can not be
done.”</p>

<p>While these scenes were transpiring the Crown Prince was
habitually residing at Potsdam, a favorite royal residence about
seventeen miles west from Berlin. Here he was rigidly attending
to his duties in the giant regiment. We have now, in our
narrative, reached the year 1727. Fritz is fifteen years of age.
He is attracting attention by his vivacity, his ingenuous, agreeable
manners, and his fondness for polite literature. He occasionally
is summoned by his father to the Smoking Cabinet.
But the delicacy of his physical organization is such that he
loathes tobacco, and only pretends to smoke, with mock gravity
puffing from his empty, white clay pipe. Neither has he any
relish for the society which he meets there. Though faithful to
the mechanical duties of the drill, they were very irksome to
him. His books and his flute were his chief joy. Voltaire was
just then rising to celebrity in France. His writings began to
attract the attention of literary men throughout Europe. Fritz,
in his youthful enthusiasm, was charmed by them. In the latter
part of June, 1729, a courier brought the intelligence to Berlin
that George I. had suddenly died of apoplexy. He was on
a journey to Hanover when he was struck down on the road.
Almost insensible, he was conveyed, on the full gallop, to Osnabrück,
where his brother, who was a bishop, resided, and where
medical aid could be obtained. But the shaft was fatal. At
midnight his carriage reached Osnabrück. The old man, sixty-seven
years of age, was heard to murmur, “It is all over with
me,” and his spirit passed away to the judgment.</p>

<p>The death of George I. affected the strange Frederick William
very deeply. He not only shed tears, but, if we may be pardoned
the expression, blubbered like a child. His health seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
to fail, and hypochondria, in its most melancholy form, tormented
him. As is not unusual in such cases, he became excessively religious.
Every enjoyment was deemed sinful, if we except the
indulgence in an ungovernable temper, which the self-righteous
king made no attempt to curb. Wilhelmina, describing this
state of things with her graphic pen, writes:</p>

<p>“He condemned all pleasures; damnable all of them, he said.
You were to speak of nothing but the Word of God only. All
other conversation was forbidden. It was always he who carried
on the improving talk at table, where he did the office of
reader, as if it had been a refectory of monks. The king treated
us to a sermon every afternoon. His valet de chambre gave
out a psalm, which we all sang. You had to listen to this sermon
with as much devout attention as if it had been an apostle’s.
My brother and I had all the mind in the world to laugh.
We tried hard to keep from laughing, but often we burst out.
Thereupon reprimand, with all the anathemas of the Church
hurled on us, which we had to take with a contrite, penitent air—a
thing not easy to bring your face to at the moment.”</p>

<p>In this frame of mind, the king began to talk seriously of abdicating
in favor of Frederick, and of retiring from the cares of
state to a life of religious seclusion in his country seat at Wusterhausen.
He matured his plan quite to the details. Wilhelmina
thus describes it:</p>

<p>“He used to say that he would reserve for himself ten thousand
crowns a year, and retire with the queen and his daughters
to Wusterhausen. ‘There,’ added he, ‘I will pray to God, and
manage the farming economy, while my wife and girls take care
of the household matters. You, Wilhelmina, are clever; I will
give you the inspection of the linen, which you shall mend and
keep in order, taking good charge of laundry matters. Frederica,
who is miserly, shall have charge of all the stores of the
house. Charlotte shall go to market and buy our provisions.
My wife shall take charge of the little children and of the
kitchen.’”</p>

<p>At that time the family consisted of nine children. Next to
Wilhelmina and Fritz came Frederica, thirteen; Charlotte, eleven;
Sophie Dorothee, eight; Ulrique, seven; August Wilhelm,
five; Amelia, four; and Henry, a babe in arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
Some of the courtiers, in order to divert the king from his
melancholy, and from these ideas of abdication, succeeded in impressing
upon him the political necessity of visiting Augustus,
the King of Poland, at Dresden. The king did not intend to
take Fritz with him. But Wilhelmina adroitly whispered a
word to Baron Suhm, the Polish embassador, and obtained a
special invitation for the Crown Prince. It is a hundred miles
from Berlin to Dresden—a distance easily traversed by post in
a day. It was the middle of January, 1728, when the Prussian
king reached Dresden, followed the day after by his son. They
were sumptuously entertained for four weeks in a continuous
round of magnificent amusements, from which the melancholic
King of Prussia recoiled, but could not well escape.</p>

<p>Augustus, King of Poland, called “Augustus the Strong,” was
a man of extraordinary physical vigor and muscular strength.
It was said that he could break horseshoes with his hands, and
crush half-crowns between his finger and thumb. He was an
exceedingly profligate man, introducing to his palaces scenes of
sin and shame which could scarcely have been exceeded in Rome
in the most corrupt days of the Cæsars. Though Frederick
William, a stanch Protestant, was a crabbed, merciless man,
drinking deeply and smoking excessively, he was irreproachable
in morals, according to the ordinary standard. Augustus, nominally
a Catholic, and zealously advocating political Catholicism,
though a good-natured, rather agreeable man, recognized no other
law of life than his own pleasure.</p>

<p>Augustus had formed apparently the deliberate resolve to
test his visitor by the most seductive and adroitly-arranged
temptations. But, so far as Frederick William was concerned,
he utterly failed. Upon one occasion his Prussian majesty, when
conducted by Augustus, whirled around and indignantly left the
room. That evening, through his minister, Grumkow, he informed
the King of Poland that if there were any repetition of
such scenes he would immediately leave Dresden.</p>

<p>Fritz, however, had not his father’s strength to resist the allurements
of this wicked court. He was but sixteen years of
age. From childhood he had been kept secluded from the world,
and had been reared under the sternest discipline. He was remarkably
handsome, full of vivacity, which qualified him to shine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
in any society, and was heir to the Prussian monarchy. He was,
consequently, greatly caressed, and every conceivable inducement
was presented to him to lure him into the paths of guilty pleasure.
He fell. From such a fall one never on earth recovers.
Even though repentance and reformation come, a scar is left upon
the soul which time can not efface.</p>

<p>This visit to Dresden, so fatal to Fritz, was closed on the 12th
of February. The dissipation of those four weeks introduced
the Crown Prince to habits which have left an indelible stain
upon his reputation, and which poisoned his days. Upon his
return to Potsdam he was seized with a fit of sickness, and for
many years his health remained feeble. But he had entered
upon the downward course. His chosen companions were those
who were in sympathy with his newly-formed tastes. The career
of dissipation into which the young prince had plunged could
not be concealed from his eagle-eyed father. The king’s previous
dislike to his son was converted into contempt and hatred,
which feelings were at times developed in almost insane ebullitions
of rage.</p>

<p>Still the queen-mother, Sophie Dorothee, clung to the double
marriage. Her brother, George II., was now King of England.
His son Fred, who had been intended for Wilhelmina, was not
a favorite of his father’s, and had not yet been permitted to go
to England. In May, 1728, he was twenty-one years of age. He
was living idly in Hanover, impatient to wed his cousin Wilhelmina,
who was then nineteen years of age. He seems to
have secretly contemplated, in conference with Wilhelmina’s
mother, Sophie Dorothee, a trip incognito to Berlin, where he
would marry the princess clandestinely, and then leave it with
the royal papas to settle the difficulty the best way they could.
The plan was not executed. Wilhelmina manifested coquettish
indifference to the whole matter. She, however, writes that
Queen Sophie was so confidently expecting him that “she took
every ass or mule for his royal highness.”</p>

<p>In May the King of Poland returned the visit of Frederick
William. He came with a numerous retinue and in great splendor.
During the past year his unhappy wife had died; and he,
then fifty-five years of age, was seeking to bargain for the hand
of Wilhelmina, hoping, by an alliance with Prussia, to promote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
some of his political schemes. The wicked old Polish king was
much broken by age and his “terrible debaucheries.” He had
recently suffered the amputation of two toes from an ulcerated
foot, which no medical skill could cure. He was brought into
the palace at Berlin in a sedan, covered with red velvet embroidered
with gold. Wilhelmina had no suspicion of the object of
his visit, and was somewhat surprised by the intensity of his
gaze and his glowing compliments. Diplomatic obstacles arose
which silenced the question of the marriage before Wilhelmina
knew that it had been contemplated.</p>

<p>Fritz had been for some time confined to his chamber and to
his bed. He was now getting out again. By his mother’s persuasion
he wrote to his aunt, Queen Caroline of England, expressing,
in the strongest terms, his love for her daughter the
Princess Amelia, and his unalterable determination never to marry
unless he could lead her to the altar. Though Frederick William
knew nothing of these intrigues, he hated his son with daily
increasing venom. Sometimes, in a surly fit, he would not speak
to him or recognize him. Again he would treat him with studied
contempt, at the table refusing to give him any food, leaving
him to fast while the others were eating. Not unfrequently,
according to Wilhelmina’s account, he even boxed his ears, and
smote him with his cane. Wilhelmina gives us one of the letters
of her brother to his father about this time, and the characteristic
paternal answer. Frederick writes, under date of September
11, 1728, from Wusterhausen:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Papa</span>,—I have not, for a long while, presumed to
come near my dear papa, partly because he forbade me, but
chiefly because I had reason to expect a still worse reception
than usual; and for fear of angering my dear papa by my present
request, I have preferred making it in writing to him.</p>

<p>“I therefore beg my dear papa to be gracious to me; and can
here say that, after long reflection, my conscience has not accused
me of any the least thing with which I could reproach myself.
But if I have, against my will and knowledge, done any thing
which has angered my dear papa, I herewith most submissively
beg forgiveness, and hope my dear papa will lay aside that cruel
hatred which I can not but notice in all his treatment of me. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
could not otherwise suit myself to it, as I always thought I had
a gracious papa, and now have to see the contrary. I take confidence,
then, and hope that my dear papa will consider all this,
and again be gracious to me. And in the mean while I assure
him that I will never, all my days, fail with my will; and, notwithstanding
his disfavor to me, remain my dear papa’s most
faithful and obedient servant and son,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Frederick</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>The returning messenger took back the following reply. It
was, as usual, ungrammatical, miserably spelled, and confused.
Contemptuously the king spoke of his son in the third person,
writing <em>he</em> and <em>his</em> instead of <em>you</em> and <em>yours</em>. Abruptly he commences:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“His obstinate perverse disposition which does not love his
father; for when one does every thing, and really loves one’s father,
one does what the father requires, not while he is there to
see it, but when his back is turned too. For the rest he knows
very well that I can endure no effeminate fellow who has no human
inclination in him; who puts himself to shame, can not ride
or shoot; and, withal, is dirty in his person, frizzles his hair like
a fool, and does not cut it off. And all this I have a thousand
times reprimanded, but all in vain, and no improvement in nothing.
For the rest, haughty; proud as a churl; speaks to nobody
but some few, and is not popular and affable; and cuts grimaces
with his face as if he were a fool; and does my will in nothing
but following his own whims; no use to him in any thing else.
This is the answer.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Frederick William.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Still the question of the marriages remained the subject of innumerable
intrigues. There were several claimants for the hand
of Wilhelmina, and many nuptial alliances suggested for Fritz.
Frederick William proposed the marriage of Wilhelmina to Fred,
the Prince of Wales, and to let the marriage of Fritz and Amelia
for the present remain undecided. But England promptly replied
“No; both marriages or none.” It is intimated by the
ministers of the Prussian king that he was influenced in his vacillating
course respecting the marriages not only by his doubts
whether the English or a German alliance would be most desirable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
but also by avarice, as he knew not what dowry he could
secure with the English princess, and by jealousy, as he was very
unwilling to add to the importance and the power of his hated
son Fritz. He also disliked extremely his brother-in-law,
George II.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>About the middle of January, 1729, the king went upon a
hunt with his companions, taking with him Fritz, who he knew
detested the rough barbaric sport. This hunting expedition to
the wilds of Brandenburg and Pommern was one of great renown.
Three thousand six hundred and two wild swine these
redoubtable Nimrods boasted as the fruits of their prowess.
Frederick William was an economical prince. He did not allow
one pound of this vast mass of wild pork to be wasted. Every
man, according to his family, was bound to take a certain portion
at a fixed price. From this fierce raid through swamps and jungles
in pursuit of wild boars the king returned to Potsdam.
Soon after he was taken sick. Having ever been a hard drinker,
it is not strange that his disease proved to be the gout. He was
any thing but an amiable patient. The pangs of the disease extorted
from him savage growls, and he vented his spleen upon
all who came within the reach of his crutch or the hearing of his
tongue. Still, even when suffering most severely, he never omitted
any administrative duties. His secretaries every morning
came in with their papers, and he issued his orders with his customary
rigorous devotion to business. It was remarked that
this strange man would never allow a profane expression or an
indelicate allusion in his presence. This sickness lasted five
weeks, and Wilhelmina writes, “The pains of Purgatory could
not equal those which we endured.”</p>

<p>During this sickness a very curious scene occurred, characteristic
of the domestic life of this royal family. The second daughter,
Frederica Louisa, “beautiful as an angel, and a spoiled child
of fifteen,” was engaged to the Marquis of Anspach. We will
allow Wilhelmina to describe the event which took place at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
table. It was early in March, 1729, while the king was still
suffering from the gout:</p>

<p>“At table his majesty told the queen that he had letters from
Anspach; the young marquis to be at Berlin in May for his
wedding; that M. Bremer, his tutor, was just coming with the
ring of betrothal for Louisa. He asked my sister if that gave
her pleasure, and how she would regulate her housekeeping
when married. My sister had got into the way of telling him
whatever she thought, and home truths sometimes, without his
taking it ill. She answered, with her customary frankness, that
she would have a good table, which should be delicately served,
and, added she, ‘which shall be better than yours. And if I
have children I will not maltreat them like you, nor force them
to eat what they have an aversion to.’</p>

<p>“‘What do you mean by that?’ replied the king; ‘what is
there wanting at my table?’</p>

<p>“‘There is this wanting,’ she said, ‘that one can not have
enough; and the little there is consists of coarse pot-herbs that
nobody can eat.’</p>

<p>“The king, as was not unnatural, had begun to get angry at
her first answer. This last put him quite in a fury. But all his
anger fell on my brother and me. He first threw a plate at my
brother’s head, who ducked out of the way. He then let fly another
at me, which I avoided in like manner. A hail-storm of
abuse followed these first hostilities. He rose into a passion
against the queen, reproaching her with the bad training which
she gave her children, and, addressing my brother, said,</p>

<p>“‘You have reason to curse your mother, for it is she who
causes your being an ill-governed fellow. I had a preceptor,’
continued he, ‘who was an honest man. I remember always a
story which he told me in his youth. There was a man at Carthage
who had been condemned to die for many crimes he had
committed. While they were leading him to execution he desired
he might speak to his mother. They brought his mother.
He came near, as if to whisper something to her, and bit away a
piece of her ear. “I treat you thus,” said he, “to make you an
example to all parents who take no heed to bring up their children
in the practice of virtue.” Make the application,’ continued
he, always addressing my brother; and, getting no answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
from him, he again set to abusing us till he could speak no longer.</p>

<p>“We rose from table. As we had to pass near him in going
out, he aimed a great blow at me with his crutch, which, if I had
not jerked away from it, would have ended me. He chased me
for a while in his wheel-chair, but the people drawing it gave
me time to escape to the queen’s chamber.”</p>

<p>That evening Wilhelmina was taken sick with burning fever
and severe pain. Still she was compelled to rise from her bed
and attend a court party. The next morning she was worse.
The king, upon being told of it, exclaimed gruffly, “Ill? I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
cure you!” and compelled her to swallow a large draught of
wine. Soon her sickness showed itself to be small-pox. Great
was the consternation of her mother, from the fear that, even
should she survive, her beauty would be so marred that the English
prince would no longer desire her as his bride. Fortunately
she escaped without a scar.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">While</span> Frederick William was confined to his room, tormented
by the gout, he endeavored to beguile the hours in painting
in oil. Some of these paintings still exist, with the epigraph,
“Painted by Frederick William in his torments.” Wilhelmina
writes:</p>

<p>“For the most part, one of his own grenadiers was the model
from which he copied. And when the portrait had more color
in it than the original, he was in the habit of coloring the cheeks
of the soldier to correspond with the picture. Enchanted with
the fruits of his genius, he showed them to his courtiers, and
asked their opinion concerning them. As he would have been
very angry with any one who had criticised them, he was quite
sure of being gratified with admiration.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said he one day to an attendant, who was extolling
the beauties of one of his pictures, ‘how much do you think that
picture would bring at a sale?’</p>

<p>“‘Sire, it would be cheap at a hundred ducats.’</p>

<p>“‘You shall have it for fifty,’ said the king, ‘because you are
a good judge, and I am therefore anxious to do you a favor.’</p>

<p>“The poor courtier,” Wilhelmina adds, “obliged to become
possessor of this miserable performance, and to pay so dear for
it, determined for the future to be more circumspect in his admiration.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
While the king was thus suffering the pangs of the gout, his
irascibility vented itself upon his wife and children. “We were
obliged,” says Wilhelmina, “to appear at nine o’clock in the
morning in his room. We dined there, and did not dare to leave
it even for a moment. Every day was passed by the king in
invectives against my brother and myself. He no longer called
me any thing but ‘the English blackguard.’ My brother was
named the ‘rascal Fritz.’ He obliged us to eat and drink the
things for which we had an aversion. Every day was marked
by some sinister event. It was impossible to raise one’s eyes
without seeing some unhappy people tormented in one way or
other. The king’s restlessness did not allow him to remain in
bed. He had himself placed in a chair on rollers, and was thus
dragged all over the palace. His two arms rested upon crutches,
which supported them. We always followed this triumphal
car, like unhappy captives who are about to undergo their sentence.”</p>

<p>We have now reached the summer of 1729. George II. was
a weak-minded, though a proud, conceited man, who, as King of
England, assumed airs of superiority which greatly annoyed
his irascible and petulant brother-in-law, Frederick William.
Flushed with his new dignity, he visited his hereditary domain
of Hanover. The journey led him through a portion of the
Prussian territory. Courtesy required that George II. should
announce that intention to the Prussian king. Courtesy also required
that, as the British monarch passed over Prussian soil,
Frederick William should furnish him with free post-horses. “I
will furnish the post-horses,” said Frederick William, “if the king
apprise me of his intention. If he do not, I shall do nothing
about it.” George did not write. In affected unconsciousness
that there was any such person in the world as the Prussian
king, he crossed the Prussian territory, paid for his own post-horses,
and did not even condescend to give Frederick William
any notice of his arrival in Hanover. The King of Prussia, who
could not but be conscious of the vast inferiority of Prussia to
England, stung to the quick by this contemptuous treatment,
growled ferociously in the Tobacco Parliament.</p>

<p>The English minister at Berlin, Dubourgay, wrote to Hanover,
urging that some notification of the king’s arrival should be sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
to the Prussian court to appease the angry sovereign. George
replied through Lord Townshend that, “under the circumstances,
it is not necessary.” Thus the two kings were no longer on
speaking terms. It is amusing, while at the same time it is humiliating,
to observe these traits of frail childhood thus developed
in full-grown men wearing crowns. When private men or
kings are in such a state of latent hostility, an open rupture is
quite certain soon to follow. George accused Frederick William
of recruiting soldiers in Hanover. In retaliation, he seized some
Prussian soldiers caught in Hanoverian territory. There was an
acre or so of land, called the “Meadow of Clamei,” which both
Hanover and Brandenburg claimed. The grass, about eight cart-loads,
had been cut by Brandenburg, and was well dried.</p>

<p>On the 28th of June, 1729, the population of Bühlitz, a Hanoverian
border village, sallied forth with carts, escorted by a
troop of horse, and, with demonstrations both defiant and exultant,
raked up and carried off all the hay. The King of Prussia
happened to be at that time about one hundred miles distant
from Bühlitz, at Magdeburg, reviewing his troops. He was
thrown into a towering passion. Sophie Dorothee, Wilhelmina,
Fritz, all felt the effects of his rage. Dubourgay writes, under
date of July 30, 1729:</p>

<p>“Her majesty, all in tears, complained of her situation. The
king is nigh losing his senses on account of the differences with
Hanover; goes from bed to bed in the night-time, and from
chamber to chamber, like one whose brains are turned. Took
a fit at two in the morning lately to be off to Wusterhausen.
Since his return he gives himself up entirely to drink. The king
will not suffer the prince royal to sit next his majesty at table,
but obliges him to go to the lower end, where things are so ordered
that the poor prince often rises without getting one bit,
insomuch that the queen was obliged two days ago to send, by
one of the servants who could be trusted, a box of cold fowls
and other eatables for his royal highness’s subsistence.”</p>

<p>Frederick William, in his extreme exasperation, seriously contemplated
challenging George II. to a duel. In his own mind
he arranged all the details—the place of meeting, the weapons,
the seconds. With a stern sense of justice, characteristic of the
man, he admitted that it would not be right to cause the blood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
of his subjects to flow in a quarrel which was merely personal.
But the “eight cart-loads of hay” had been taken under circumstances
so insulting and contemptuous as to expose the Prussian
king to ridicule; and he was firm in his determination to settle
the difficulty by a duel. The question was much discussed in
the Tobacco Parliament. The Prussian ministers opposed in
vain. “The true method, I tell you,” said the king, “is the duel,
let the world cackle as it may.”</p>

<p>But at length one of the counselors, Baron Borck, urged the
following consideration: “Swords will be the weapons used.
Your majesty has been very sick, is now weak, and also crippled
with gout. The King of England is in health and vigor. There
is great danger that your majesty may be worsted in the combat.
That would render matters tenfold worse.”</p>

<p>The king was staggered. War seemed the only alternative.
But war would empty his money-casks, disfigure his splendid
troops, and peril the lives even of his costly giants. One of these
men, James Kirkman, picked up in the streets of London, cost
the king six thousand dollars “before he could be inveigled,
shipped, and brought to hand.” Nearly all had cost large sums
of money. Such men were too valuable to be exposed to danger.
Frederick William was in a state of extreme nervous excitement.
There was no rest for him night or day. His deep
potations did not calm his turbulent spirit. War seemed imminent.
Military preparations were in vigorous progress. Ovens
were constructed to bake ammunition bread. Artillery was
dragged out from the arsenals. It was rumored that the Prussian
troops were to march immediately upon the duchy of Mecklenburg,
which was then held by George II. as an appendage to
Hanover.</p>

<p>All thoughts of the double marriage were for the moment relinquished.
The Czar of Russia had a son and a daughter. It
was proposed to marry Wilhelmina to the son and Fritz to the
daughter, and thus to secure a Russian instead of an English alliance.
Harassed by these difficulties, Frederick William grew
increasingly morose, venting his spite upon his wife and children.
Fritz seriously contemplated escaping from his father’s abuse by
flight, and to take refuge with his uncle George in England, and
thus to secure his marriage with Amelia. The portraits of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
princess which he had seen proved her to be very beautiful. All
reports pronounced her to be as lovely in character as in person.
He was becoming passionately attached to her. Wilhelmina
was his only confidante. Regard for her alone restrained him
from attempting to escape. “He would have done so long ago,”
writes Dubourgay, under date of August 11, 1729, “were it not
for his sister, upon whom the whole weight of his father’s resentment
would then fall. Happen what will, therefore, he is
resolved to share with her all the hardships which the king, his
father, may be pleased to put upon her.”</p>

    <div class="caption">WILHELMINA.</div></div>

<p>One night, about the middle of August, as the king was tossing
restlessly upon his pillow, he sprang from his bed, exclaiming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
“Eureka! I now see what will bring a settlement.” Immediately
a special messenger was dispatched, with terms of
compromise, to Kannegiesser, the king’s embassador at Hanover.
We do not know what the propositions were. But the king
was exceedingly anxious to avoid war. He had, in many respects,
a very stern sense of justice, and would not do that which
he considered to be wrong. When he abused his family or others
he did not admit that he was acting unjustly. He assumed,
and with a sort of fanatical conscientiousness, detestable as it
was, that he was doing right; that they deserved the treatment.
And now he earnestly desired peace, and was disposed to present
the most honorable terms to avert a war.</p>

<p>Kannegiesser, at Hanover, received the king’s propositions for
reconciliation at ten o’clock in the morning of the 15th of August,
1729. George II. was then absent on a hunting excursion.
The Prussian embassador called immediately at the council-chamber
of the Hanoverian court, and informed M. Hartoff, the
privy secretary, that he wished an audience with the ministry,
then in session, to make a proposition to them from the Prussian
court. Hartoff, who had met Kannegiesser in a room adjoining
the council-chamber, reported the request to the council, and returned
with the disrespectful answer that “M. Kannegiesser
must defer what he has to say to some other time.”</p>

<p>The Prussian minister condescended then so importunately to
urge an audience, in view of the menacing state of affairs, that
M. Hartoff returned to the council-chamber, and in seven minutes
came back with an evasive answer, still refusing to grant an audience.
The next day M. Kannegiesser called again at the council-chamber.
“I let them know in the mildest terms,” he writes
in his dispatch home, “that I desired to be admitted to speak
with them, which was refused me a second time.” He then informed
M. Hartoff that the Prussian court expected a definite
answer to some propositions which had previously been sent to
the council at Hanover; that he would remain two days to receive
it; that, in case he did not receive it, he would call again,
to remind them that an answer was desired.</p>

<p>The next day M. Hartoff called at the residence of M. Kannegiesser,
and informed him “that the ministers, understanding
that he designed to ask an audience to-morrow to remind them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
of the answer which he demanded, wished to say that such applications
were not customary among sovereign princes; that
they dared not treat farther in that affair with him; that, as soon
as they received instructions from his Britannic majesty, they
would communicate to him the result.”</p>

<p>The Prussian minister replied that he could not conceive why
he should be refused an audience; that he should not fail to be
at the council-chamber at eleven o’clock the next day to receive
an answer to the proposals already made, and also to the proposals
which he was prepared to make. He endeavored to inform
Hartoff of the terms of compromise which the Prussian king was
ready to present. But Hartoff refused to hear him, declaring
that he had positive orders not to listen to any thing he had to
say upon the subject. We will give the conclusion in the words
of the Prussian minister, as found in his dispatch of the 18th of
August, 1729:</p>

<p>“At eleven this day I went to the council-chamber for the
third time, and desired Secretary Hartoff to prevail with the
ministry to allow me to speak with them, and communicate what
the King of Prussia had ordered me to propose. Herr von Hartoff
gave them an account of my request, and brought me, for
answer, that I must wait a little, because the ministers were not
yet all assembled; which I did. But after having made me stay
almost an hour, and after the president of the council was come,
Herr von Hartoff came out to me and repeated what he had said
yesterday, in very positive and absolute terms, that the ministers
were resolved not to see me, and had expressly forbid him taking
any paper at my hands.</p>

<p>“To which I replied, that this was very hard usage, and the
world would see how the King of Prussia would relish it. But
having strict orders from his majesty, my most gracious master,
to make a declaration to the ministers of Hanover in his name,
and finding that Herr von Hartoff would neither receive it nor
take a copy of it, I had only to tell him that I was under the necessity
of leaving it in writing, and had brought the paper with me;
and that now, as the council were pleased to refuse to take it, I
was obliged to leave the said declaration on a table in an adjoining
room, in the presence of Herr von Hartoff and other secretaries
of the council, whom I desired to lay it before the ministry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
“After this I went home, but had scarcely entered my apartment
when a messenger returned me, by order of the ministers,
the declaration, still sealed as I left it; and perceiving that I
was not inclined to receive it, he laid it on my table, and immediately
left the house.”</p>

<p>Having met with this repulse, Kannegiesser returned to Berlin
with the report. Frederick William was exasperated in the
highest degree by such treatment from a brother-in-law whom
he both hated and despised. He had at his command an army
in as perfect condition, both in equipment and drill, as Europe
had ever seen. Within a week’s time forty-four thousand troops,
horse, foot, and artillery, were rendezvoused at Magdeburg.
Fritz was there, looking quite soldierly on his proud charger, at
the head of his regiment of the giant guard. Vigorously they
were put upon the march. George II., who had already in his
boyhood felt the weight of Frederick William’s arm, and who
well knew his desperate energy when once roused, was terrified.
He had no forces in Hanover which could stand for an hour in
opposition to the army which the Prussian king was bringing
against him.</p>

<p>War between Prussia and England might draw all the neighboring
nations into the conflict. There was excitement in every
continental court. The Pope, it is reported, was delighted. “He
prays,” says Carlyle, “that Heaven would be graciously pleased
to foment and blow up to the proper degree this quarrel between
the two chief heretical powers, Heaven’s chief enemies,
whereby holy religion might reap a good benefit.”</p>

<p>In the general alarm, France, Holland, and other neighboring
courts interposed and called loudly for a settlement. Frederick
William had never wished for war. George II. was thoroughly
frightened. As it was certain that he would be severely chastised,
he was eager to escape from the difficulty through the mediation
of others. An arbitration was agreed upon, and the
quarrel was settled without bloodshed.</p>

<p>On the 8th of September Fritz returned to Potsdam from this
his first military expedition, with his regiment of giants. He
was then seventeen years of age. His soldierly bearing had
quite rejoiced the king, and he began to think that, after all, possibly
something might be made of Fritz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
Just as these troubles were commencing, there was, in May,
1729, a marriage in the Prussian royal family. Some two hundred
miles south of Brandenburg there was, at that time, a small
marquisate called Anspach, next in dignity to a dukedom. The
marquis was a frail, commonplace boy of seventeen, under the
care of a young mother, who was widowed, sick, and dying.
Much to the dissatisfaction of Sophie Dorothee, the queen-mother,
Frederick William had arranged a marriage between this
young man, who was far from rich, and his second daughter,
Frederica Louisa, who was then fifteen years of age.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Fritz went in the royal carriage, with suitable escort, to meet
the young marquis on the Prussian frontier, as he came to his
bridals. They returned together in the carriage to Potsdam
with great military display. The wedding took place on the
30th of May, 1729. It was very magnificent. Fritz was conspicuous
on the occasion in a grand review of the giant grenadiers.
Wilhelmina, in her journal, speaks quite contemptuously
of her new brother-in-law, the Marquis of Anspach, describing
him as a foolish young fellow. It was, indeed, a marriage of
children. The bridegroom was a sickly, peevish, undeveloped
boy of seventeen; and the bride was a self-willed and ungoverned
little beauty of fifteen. The marriage proved a very unhappy
one. There was no harmony between them. Frederick
writes: “They hate one another like the fire” (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comme le feu</i>).
They, however, lived together in incessant petty quarrelings for
thirty years. Probably during all that time neither one of them
saw a happy day.</p>

<p>Fritz had now attained eighteen years of age, and Wilhelmina
twenty-one. Fritz was very fond of music, particularly of his
flute, upon which he played exquisitely, being, however, careful
never to sound its notes within hearing of his father. A celebrated
music-master from Dresden, by the name of Quantz, was
his teacher. He came occasionally from Dresden and spent a
week or two at Potsdam, secretly teaching the young prince.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
The mother of Fritz was in warm sympathy with her son, and
aided him in all ways in her power in this gratification. Still it
was a very hazardous measure. The fierce old king was quite
uncertain in his movements. He might at any hour appear at
Potsdam, and no one could tell to what lengths, in case of a discovery,
he might go in the intensity of his rage. Fritz had an
intimate friend in the army, a young man of about his own age,
one Lieutenant Katte, who, when Fritz was with his music-teacher,
was stationed on the look-out, that he might give instant
warning in case there were any indications of the king’s approach.
His mother also was prepared, when Quantz was at Potsdam,
promptly to dispatch a messenger to her son in case she suspected
his father of being about to turn his steps in that direction.</p>

<p>Fritz, having thus established his outposts, was accustomed
to retire to his room with his teacher, lay aside his tight-fitting
Prussian military coat, which he detested, and called his shroud,
draw on a very beautiful, flowing French dressing-gown of scarlet,
embroidered with gold, and decorated with sash and tags,
and, with his hair dressed in the most fashionable style of the
French court, surrender himself to the indulgence of his own
luxurious tastes for sumptuous attire as well as for melodious
sounds. He was thus, one day, in the height of his enjoyment,
taking his clandestine music-lesson, when Lieutenant Katte came
rushing into the room in the utmost dismay, with the announcement
that the king was at the door. The wily and ever-suspicious
monarch had stolen the march upon them. He was about
to make his son a very unwelcome surprise visit.</p>

<p>A bomb bursting in the room could scarcely have created a
greater panic. Katte and Quantz seized the flutes and music-books,
and rushed into a wood-closet, where they stood quaking
with terror. Fritz threw off his dressing-gown, hurried on his
military coat, and sat down at the table, affecting to be deeply
engaged with his books. The king, frowning like a thunder-cloud—for
he always frowned when he drew near Fritz—burst
into the room. The sight of the frizzled hair of his son “kindled
the paternal wrath into a tornado pitch.” The king had a wonderful
command of the vocabulary of abuse, and was heaping
epithets of vituperation upon the head of the prince, when he
caught sight of the dressing-gown behind a screen. He seized
the glittering garment, and, with increasing outbursts of rage,
crammed it into the fire. Then searching the room, he collected
all the French books, of which Fritz had quite a library, and,
sending for a bookseller near by, ordered him to take every volume
away, and sell them for what they would bring. For more
than an hour the king was thus raging, like a maniac, in the
apartment of his son. Fortunately he did not look into the
wood-closet. Had he done so, both Quantz and Katte would
have been terribly beaten, even had they escaped being sent immediately
to the scaffold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
“The king,” writes Wilhelmina, “almost caused my brother
and myself to die of hunger. He always acted as carver, and
served every body except us. When, by chance, there remained
any thing in the dish, he spit in it, to prevent our eating of it.
We lived entirely upon coffee, milk, and dried cherries, which
ruined our health. I was nourished with insults and invectives,
and was abused all day long, in every possible manner, and before
every body. The king’s anger went so far against my brother
and myself that he drove us from him, forbidding us to appear
in his presence except at meals.</p>

<p>“The queen had contrived in her bedroom a sort of labyrinth
of screens, so arranged that I could escape the king without being
seen, in case he suddenly entered. One day the king came
and surprised us. I wished to escape, but found myself embarrassed
among these screens, of which several fell, and prevented
my getting out of the room. The king was at my heels, and
tried to catch hold of me in order to beat me. Not being able
any longer to escape, I placed myself behind my governess. The
king advanced so much that she was obliged to fall back, but,
finding herself at length near the chimney, she was stopped. I
found myself in the alternative of bearing the fire or the blows.
The king overwhelmed me with abuse, and tried to seize me by
the hair. I fell upon the floor. The scene would have had a
tragical end had it continued, as my clothes were actually beginning
to take fire. The king, fatigued with crying out and with
his passion, at length put an end to it and went away.”</p>

<p>These sufferings bound the brother and sister very intimately
together. “This dear brother,” Wilhelmina writes, “passed all
his afternoons with me. We read and wrote together, and occupied
ourselves in cultivating our minds. The king now never
saw my brother without threatening him with the cane. Fritz
repeatedly told me that he would bear any thing from the king
except blows; but that, if he ever came to such extremities with
him, he would regain his freedom by flight.”</p>

<p>On the 10th of December, 1729, Dubourgay writes in his journal:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
“His Prussian majesty can not bear the sight of either the
prince or the princess royal. The other day he asked the prince,
‘Kalkstein makes you English, does not he?’ To which the
prince answered, ‘I respect the English, because I know the people
there love me.’ Upon which the king seized him by the
collar, struck him fiercely with his cane, and it was only by superior
strength that the poor prince escaped worse. There is a
general apprehension of something tragical taking place before
long.”</p>

<p>Wilhelmina gives the following account of this transaction, as
communicated to her by her brother: “As I entered the king’s
room this morning, he first seized me by the hair and then threw
me on the floor, along which, after having exercised the vigor of
his arm upon my unhappy person, he dragged me, in spite of all
my resistance, to a neighboring window. His intention apparently
was to perform the office of the mutes of the seraglio, for,
seizing the cord belonging to the curtain, he placed it around
my neck. I seized both of his hands, and began to cry out. A
servant came to my assistance, and delivered me from his hands.”</p>

<p>In reference to this event, the prince wrote to his mother from
Potsdam, “I am in the utmost despair. What I had always apprehended
has at last come on me. The king has entirely forgotten
that I am his son. This morning I came into his room
as usual. At the first sight of me he sprang forward, seized me
by the collar, and struck me a shower of blows with his rattan.
I tried in vain to screen myself, he was in so terrible a rage, almost
out of himself. It was only weariness that made him give
up. I am driven to extremity. I have too much honor to endure
such treatment, and I am resolved to put an end to it in
one way or another.”</p>

<p>Wilhelmina well understood that her brother contemplated
running away, escaping, if possible, to England. We have mentioned
that the young prince, after his return from Dresden, had
become quite dissipated. The companions he chose were wild
young army officers of high birth, polished address, and, in godless
lives, fashionable men of the world. Lieutenant Katte was
a genteel man of pleasure. Another of his bosom companions,
Lieutenant Keith, a young man of illustrious lineage, was also a
very undesirable associate for any young man whose principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
of virtue were not established.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Of Keith and Katte, the two
most intimate friends of Fritz, Wilhelmina writes, about this
time:</p>

<div id="ip_71" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.0625em;">
  <img src="images/i_071.jpg" width="449" height="460" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">A ROYAL EXECUTIONER.</div></div>

<p>“Lieutenant Keith had been gone some time, stationed in
Wesel with his regiment. Keith’s departure had been a great
joy to me, in the hope my brother would now lead a more regular
life. But it proved quite otherwise. A second favorite, and
a much more dangerous, succeeded Keith. This was a young
man of the name of Katte, captain lieutenant in the regiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Gens d’Armes</i>. He was highly connected in the army. His
mother was daughter of Field-marshal Wartensleben. General
Katte, his father, had sent him to the universities, and afterward
to travel, desiring that he should be a lawyer. But, as there
was no favor to be hoped for out of the army, the young man
found himself at last placed there, contrary to his expectation.
He continued to apply himself to studies. He had wit, book-culture,
and acquaintance with the world. The good company
which he continued to frequent had given him polite manners
to a degree then rare in Berlin. His physiognomy was rather
disagreeable than otherwise. A pair of thick black eyebrows
almost covered his eyes. His look had in it something ominous,
presage of the fate he met with. A tawny skin, torn by
small-pox, increased his ugliness. He affected the freethinker,
and carried libertinism to excess. A great deal of ambition and
headlong rashness accompanied this vice. Such a favorite was
not the man to bring back my brother from his follies.”</p>

<p>Early in January, 1730, the king, returning from a hunt at
Wusterhausen, during which he had held a drinking carouse
and a diplomatic interview with the King of Poland, announced
his intention of being no longer annoyed by matrimonial arrangements
for Wilhelmina. He resolved to abandon the English
alliance altogether, unless an immediate and unequivocal
assent were given by George II. for the marriage of Wilhelmina
with the Prince of Wales, without any compact for the marriage
of Fritz with the Princess Amelia. Count Finckenstein, Baron
Grumkow, and General Borck were sent to communicate this,
the king’s unalterable resolve, to the queen. The first two were
friends of the queen. Grumkow was understood to be the instigator
of the king. Wilhelmina chanced to be with her mother
when the gentlemen announced themselves as the bearers of
a very important message from the king to her majesty. Wilhelmina
trembled, and said in a low tone to her mother, “This
regards me. I have a dreading.” “No matter,” the worn and
weary mother replied; “one must have firmness, and that is not
what I shall want.” The queen retired with the ministers to
the audience-chamber.</p>

<p>There they informed her that they had each received a letter
the night before from the king, the contents of which they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
forbidden, under penalty of death, from communicating to any
one but to her. The king wished them to say to her majesty
that he would no longer endure her disobedience in reference to
the marriage of Wilhelmina; that, in case this disobedience continued,
there should be an entire separation between him and
his wife—a divorce—and that she and her daughter should both
be banished to the château of Oranienburg, about twenty miles
from Berlin, and there held in close imprisonment. The king
was willing that Sophie Dorothee should write once more, and
only once more, to her brother, George II., and demand of him a
categorical answer, yes or no, whether he would consent to the
immediate marriage of the Prince of Wales and Wilhelmina.
The king would wait a fortnight for an answer, or, if the winds
were contrary, three weeks; but not a day more. Should no
answer in that time be returned, or a negative or an evasive answer,
then Wilhelmina was to make her immediate choice of a
husband between either the Duke of Weissenfels or the Marquis
of Schwedt, and to be married without delay.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>Weissenfels was a small duchy in Saxony. The duke, so
called by courtesy, had visited Berlin before in the train of his
sovereign, King Augustus, when his majesty returned the visit
of Frederick William. He was then quite captivated by the
beauty and vivacity of Wilhelmina. He was titular duke merely,
his brother being the real duke; and he was then living on
his pay as officer in the army, and was addicted to deep potations.
Carlyle describes him as “a mere betitled, betasseled, elderly
military gentleman of no special qualities, evil or good.”
Sophie Dorothee, noticing his attentions to Wilhelmina, deemed
it the extreme of impudence for so humble a man to aspire to
the hand of her illustrious child. She reproved him so severely
that he retired from the court in deep chagrin. He never would
have presumed to renew the suit but for the encouragement
given by Frederick William.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Schwedt was a very indifferent young man,
living under the tutelage of his dowager mother. She was a
cousin of the King of Prussia, and had named her son Frederick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
William. Having rendered herself conspicuously ridiculous by
the flaunting colors of her dress, which tawdry display was in
character with her mind, both she and her son were decidedly
disagreeable to Wilhelmina.</p>

<p>There was no alternative left the young princess. Unless
there were an immediate consummation of the marriage contract
with the English Frederick, she was, without delay, to choose
between Weissenfels and Schwedt. The queen, in response to
this communication, said, “I will immediately write to England;
but, whatever may be the answer, it is impossible that my daughter
should marry either of the individuals whom the king has
designated.” Baron Grumkow, who was in entire accord with
the king, “began,” says Wilhelmina, “quoting Scripture on her
majesty, as the devil can on occasion. ‘Wives, be obedient to
your husbands,’ said he. The queen very aptly replied, ‘Yes;
but did not Bethuel, the son of Milcah, when Abraham’s servant
asked his daughter in marriage for young Isaac, answer, “We
will call the damsel, and inquire of her mouth?” It is true, wives
must obey their husbands, but husbands must command things
just and reasonable.’</p>

<p>“The king’s procedure,” added the unhappy mother, “is not
in accordance with that law. He is doing violence to my daughter’s
inclinations, thus rendering her wretched for the remainder
of her days. He wishes to give her for a husband a brutal debauchee,
a younger brother, who is nothing but an officer in the
army of the King of Poland; a landless man, without the means
of living according to his rank. I will write to England. But,
whatever the answer, I had rather a thousand times see my
child in the grave than hopelessly miserable.”</p>

<p>The queen, looking reproachfully at Grumkow, remarked, “I
know full well to whom I owe all this.” She then excused herself,
saying that she was not well, and retired to her apartment.
There she communicated to the anxious Wilhelmina the cruel
message of the king. Sophie Dorothee then wrote a very earnest
letter to Queen Caroline, the wife of George II., imploring
that all obstacles in the way of the marriage of Wilhelmina with
the Prince of Wales might be withdrawn. The idea of marriage
with either Weissenfels or Schwedt was dreadful. But, on the
other hand, the wrath of the king, the divorce of the queen, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
the imprisonment of both mother and daughter in the château
of Oranienburg, were also dreadful. Fritz was taken into the
councils of his mother and sister. It was decided that he should
also write to his aunt, urging his suit for the Princess Amelia.
It is true that George II. was ready to accede to this marriage,
but Frederick William threw obstacles in the way. It was probably
the hope of Fritz to secure Amelia, notwithstanding his father’s
opposition. The ready pen of Wilhelmina was employed
to draft the letter, which her brother submissively copied. As
it was not probable, in the intricacies in which the question was
now involved, that both marriages could take place together,
Fritz wrote pleading for the marriage of Wilhelmina at once,
pledging his word that he would remain faithful to the Princess
Amelia.</p>

<p>“I have already,” he wrote, “given your majesty my word of
honor never to wed any one but the Princess Amelia, your
daughter. I here reiterate that promise, in case your majesty
will consent to my sister’s marriage.”</p>

<p>Sophie Dorothee dispatched a courier with these documents,
to go with the utmost speed to England. It was a long journey
in those days, and the winds were often contrary. A fortnight
passed. Three weeks were gone. Still there was no answer.
On the 25th of January, 1730—“a day,” writes Wilhelmina,
“which I shall never forget”—Finckenstein, Borck, and Grumkow
again called upon the queen, with the following message
from the king:</p>

<p>“Whatever answer may now be returned from England I will
have nothing to do with it. Whether negative, affirmative, or
evasive, to me it shall be as nothing. You, madam, must now
choose between the Duke of Weissenfels and the Marquis of
Schwedt. If you do not choose, you and Wilhelmina may prepare
for Oranienburg, where you shall suffer the just penalty of
mutiny against the authority set over you by God and men.”</p>

<p>The queen summoned firmness to reply: “You can inform the
king that he will never make me consent to render my daughter
miserable; and that, so long as a breath of life remains in me, I
will not permit her to take either the one or the other of these
persons.”</p>

<p>Then addressing Grumkow, she said, in tones deliberate and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
intense, “For you, sir, who are the author of my misfortunes,
may my curse fall upon you and your house. You have this
day killed me. But I doubt not that Heaven will hear my
prayer and avenge my wrongs.”</p>

<p>The queen was at this time in a delicate state of health, and
anxiety and sorrow threw her upon a sick-bed. The king, who
felt as much affection for “Phiekin” as such a coarse, brutal man
could feel for any body, was alarmed; but he remained obdurate.
He stormed into her room, where, in the fever of her troubles, she
tossed upon her pillow, and obstreperously declared that Wilhelmina
should be married immediately, and that she must take either
Weissenfels or Schwedt. As both mother and daughter remained
firm in their refusal to choose, he resolved to decide the
question himself.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he made proposals to the Marquise of Schwedt
that Wilhelmina should marry her son. The lady replied, in
terms very creditable both to her head and her heart, “Such a
union, your majesty, would be in accordance with the supreme
wish of my life. But how can I accept such happiness against
the will of the princess herself? This I can positively never do.”
Here she remained firm. The raging king returned to the bedside
of his wife, as rough and determined as ever. He declared
that the question was now settled that Wilhelmina was to marry
the old Duke of Weissenfels.</p>

<p>The unhappy princess, distracted by these griefs, had grown
thin and pale. It was soon rumored throughout the court that
the king had written to Weissenfels, and that the duke was on
his way to seize his reluctant bride. In this emergence, the
queen’s friend, Baron Borck, suggested to her that, in order to
get rid of the obnoxious Weissenfels, she should so far yield to
the wishes of the king as to give up the English alliance, and
propose a third party, who might be more acceptable to Wilhelmina.
But who shall this substitute be?</p>

<p>About two hundred miles south of Berlin there was quite an
important marquisate called Baireuth. The marquis had a good-looking
young son, the heir-apparent, who had just returned from
the grand tour of Europe. Upon the death of his father he
would enter upon quite a rich inheritance. This young marquis,
Frederick by name, Baron Borck proposed as a substitute for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
the Duke of Weissenfels. It was understood that Wilhelmina
was such a prize that kings, even, would be eager to obtain her
hand. There could therefore be no doubt but that the Marquis
of Baireuth would feel signally honored by such nuptials. The
worn and weary mother eagerly accepted this proposal. She
suggested it to the king. Sullenly he gave it his assent, saying,
“I will passively submit to it, but will take no active part whatever
in the affair. Neither will I give Wilhelmina one single
copper for dowry.”</p>

<p>The queen, delighted in having obtained even this measure
of acquiescence on the part of the king, now conferred with Wilhelmina.
But, to her surprise and bitter disappointment, the
young princess did not share in her mother’s joy. She was not
disposed to be thus bartered away, and presented sundry objections.
The poor mother, harassed by these interminable difficulties,
now lost all patience. She broke out upon her equally unhappy
daughter with cruel reproaches.</p>

<p>“Take, then,” she exclaimed, “the Grand Turk or the Great
Mogul for your husband. Follow your own caprice. Had I
known you better I would not have brought so many sorrows
upon myself. You may follow the king’s bidding. It is henceforth
your own affair. I will no longer trouble myself about
your concerns. And spare me, if you please, the sorrows of your
odious presence. I can not stand it.”</p>

<p>Wilhelmina endeavored to reply. But the angry mother
sternly exclaimed, “Silence!” and the tortured girl left the apartment,
weeping bitterly. Even Fritz took his mother’s part, and
reproached Wilhelmina for not acceding to her plan. New troubles
were thickening around him. He was in debt. The king
had found it out. To his father’s stern questioning, Fritz, in his
terror, had uttered deliberate falsehood. He confessed a debt
of about eight hundred dollars, which his father had detected,
and solemnly declared that this was all. In fact, he owed an
additional sum of seven thousand dollars. Should the king discover
this debt, and thus detect Fritz in a lie, his rage would be
tremendous. The king paid the eight hundred dollar debt of
his son, and then issued a decree declaring that to lend money
to any princes of the blood, even to the prince royal, was a high
crime, to be punished, not only by forfeiture of the money, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
by imprisonment. The king had begun to suspect that Fritz
intended to escape. He could not escape without money. The
king therefore took special precautions that his purse should be
ever empty, and watched him with renewed vigilance.</p>

<p>While matters were in this extremity, the British minister,
Dubourgay, and Baron Knyphausen, a distinguished Prussian
official, dispatched Rev. Dr. Villa, a scholarly man, who had been
Wilhelmina’s teacher of English, on a secret mission to the court
of England, to communicate the true state of affairs, and to endeavor
to secure some disentanglement of the perplexities. Dr.
Villa was a warm friend of Wilhelmina, and, in sympathy with
her sorrows, wept as he bade her adieu. The king was in such
ill humor that his daughter dared not appear in his presence.
If Fritz came within reach of his father’s arm he was pretty sure
to receive a blow from his rattan.</p>

<p>On the 18th of February, 1730, some affairs of state led the
king to take a trip to Dresden to see the King of Poland. He
decided to take Fritz with him, as he was afraid to leave him
behind. Fritz resolved to avail himself of the opportunity which
the journey might offer to attempt his escape. He was unwilling
to do this without bidding adieu to his sister, who had been
the partner of so many of his griefs. It was not easy to obtain
a private interview. On the evening of the 17th of February,
as Wilhelmina, aided by her governess, was undressing for bed,
the door of the anteroom of her chamber was cautiously opened,
and a young gentleman, very splendidly dressed in French costume,
entered. Wilhelmina, terrified, uttered a shriek, and endeavored
to hide herself behind a screen. Her governess, Madam
Sonsfeld, ran into the anteroom to ascertain what such an
intrusion meant. The remainder of the story we will give in
the words of Wilhelmina:</p>

<p>“But she returned the next moment accompanying the cavalier,
who was laughing heartily, and whom I recognized for my
brother. His dress so altered him he seemed a different person.
He was in the best humor possible. ‘I am come to bid you
farewell once more, my dear sister,’ said he; ‘and as I know the
friendship you have for me, I will not keep you ignorant of my
designs. I go, and do not come back. I can not endure the
usage I suffer. My patience is driven to an end. It is a favorable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
opportunity for flinging off that odious yoke. I will glide
out of Dresden and get across to England, where, I do not doubt,
I shall work out your deliverance too, when I am got thither.
So I beg you calm yourself. We shall soon meet again in places
where joy shall succeed our tears, and where we shall have the
happiness to see ourselves in peace, and free from these persecutions.’”</p>

<p>Wilhelmina was appalled in view of the difficulty and danger
of the enterprise. It was a long distance from Dresden to the
coast. Head winds might detain the vessel. The suspicious
king would not long remain ignorant that he was missing. He
would be pursued with energy almost demoniac. Being captured,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
no one could tell how fearful would be his doom. The
sagacious sister was right. Fritz could not but perceive the
strength of her arguments, and gave her his word of honor that
he would not attempt, on the present occasion, to effect his flight.
Fritz accordingly went to Dresden with his father, and returned.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">In</span> the mean time Dr. Villa reached England. In conference
with the British cabinet, the members deemed it very desirable,
at all events, to effect the marriage of the Prince of Wales with
the Prussian princess. The main consideration was that it
would tend to detach Prussia from Germany, and secure its alliance
with England. It was also a good Protestant match, and
would promote the interests of Protestantism. The king desired
this marriage. But he was inflexible in his resolve that both
marriages should take place or neither. The Prussian king was
equally inflexible in his determination that, while he would consent
to one marriage, he would not consent to both. Colonel
Hotham, a man of good family and of some personal distinction,
was accordingly sent, as envoy extraordinary, to Berlin, to make
new efforts in favor of the double marriage.</p>

<p>The Queen of Prussia had recently given birth to another
prince. She was on a bed of languor. The king was somewhat
mollified, and was anxious to be relieved from these protracted
difficulties. Colonel Hotham reached the palace of Charlottenburg
on the 2d of April, 1730, and was graciously received by
the king. The next day quite a splendid dinner was given in
honor of the British envoy. All the notables who surrounded
the table, the English and the Prussian, in accordance with the
degrading custom of those times, drank deeply. Hotham, in his
dispatch, without any apparent sense of shame, writes, “We all
got immoderately drunk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
The object of Colonel Hotham’s mission was well known. The
cordial reception he had met from the king indicated that his
message was not an unwelcome one to his Prussian majesty. In
the indecent hilarity of the hour, it was assumed that the marriage
contract between Wilhelmina and the Prince of Wales was
settled. Brains addled with wine gave birth to stupid jokes
upon the subject. “A German ducat was to be exchanged for
an English half guinea.” At last, in the semi-delirium of their
intoxication, one proposed as a toast, “To the health of Wilhelmina,
Princess of Wales.” The sentiment was received with uproarious
jollity. Though all the company were in the same state
of silly inebriation, neither the king nor the British ministers,
Hotham and Dubourgay, for a moment lost sight of their settled
policy. The king remained firm in his silent resolve to consent
only to the marriage of Wilhelmina and the Prince of Wales.
Hotham and Dubourgay could not swerve from the positive instructions
which they had received, to insist upon both marriages
or neither. Thus, notwithstanding this bacchanal jollification,
neither party was disposed to swerve a hair’s breadth from
its fixed resolve, and the question was no nearer a settlement
than before.</p>

<p>Still, most of the courtly carousers did not comprehend this.
And when the toast to Wilhelmina as Princess of Wales was received
with such acclaim, they supposed that all doubt was at
an end. The news flew upon the wings of the wind to Berlin.
It was late in the afternoon of Monday, April 30. Wilhelmina
writes:</p>

<p>“I was sitting quiet in my apartment, busy with work, and
some one reading to me, when the queen’s ladies rushed in, with
a torrent of domestics in their rear, who all bawled out, putting
one knee to the ground, that they were come to salute the Princess
of Wales. I fairly believed these poor people had lost their
wits. They would not cease overwhelming me with noise and
tumult; their joy was so great they knew not what they did.
When the farce had lasted some time, they told me what had
occurred at the dinner.</p>

<p>“I was so little moved by it that I answered, going on with
my work, ‘Is that all?’ which greatly surprised them. A while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
after, my sisters and several ladies came to congratulate me. I
was much loved, and I felt more delighted at the proofs each
gave me of that than at what had occasioned their congratulations.
In the evening I went to the queen’s. You may readily
conceive her joy. On my first entrance she called me her dear
Princess of Wales, and addressed Madam De Sonsfeld as ‘Miladi.’
This latter took the liberty of hinting to her that it would
be better to keep quiet; that the king, having yet given no notice
of this business, might be provoked at such demonstration,
and that the least trifle could still ruin all her hopes.”</p>

<p>The king, upon his return from Charlottenburg to Berlin, made
no allusion whatever in his family to the matter. In the court,
however, it was generally considered that the question, so far as
Wilhelmina was concerned, was settled. Hotham held daily interviews
with the king, and received frequent communications
from the Prince of Wales, who appears to have been very eager
for the consummation of the marriage. Many of these letters
were shown to Wilhelmina. She was much gratified with the
fervor they manifested on the part of a lover who had never yet
seen her. In one of these letters the prince says: “I conjure
you, my dear Hotham, get these negotiations finished. I am
madly in love (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amoureux comme un fou</i>), and my impatience is
unequaled.”</p>

<p>The question arises, Why was Frederick William so averse to
the marriage of Fritz with the Princess Amelia? Probably the
real reason was his rooted antipathy to his son, and his consequent
unwillingness to do any thing which would promote his
interests or increase his influence. His advisers strengthened
him in this sentiment. The English were very unpopular at
Berlin. Their assumption of superiority over all other peoples
was a constant annoyance. The Prussian king said to his confidential
friends,</p>

<p>“If the English Princess Amelia come here as the bride of my
son, she will bring with her immense wealth. Accustomed to
grandeur, she will look contemptuously upon our simplicity.
With her money she can dazzle and bribe. I hate my son. He
hates me. Aided by the gold of England, my son can get up a
party antagonistic to me. No! I will never, never consent to
his marrying the Princess Amelia. If he is never married it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
no matter. Fortunately I have other sons, and the succession
will not be disturbed.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>The king had made many efforts to force his son to surrender
his rights of primogeniture, and to sign an act renouncing his
claim to the succession of the Prussian throne in favor of his
next brother. His only answer was, “Declare my birth illegitimate,
and I will give up the throne.” But the king could never
consent to fix such a stain upon the honor of his wife.</p>

<p>And why was George II. so averse to the single marriage of
the Prince of Wales to Wilhelmina? It is supposed that the opposition
arose simply from his own mulish obstinacy. He hated
his brother-in-law, the Prussian king. He was a weak, ill-tempered
man; and having once said “<em>Both marriages or none</em>,”
nothing could induce him to swerve from that position. In such
a difficulty, with such men, there could be no possible compromise.</p>

<p>George II. was far from popular in England. There was but
little in the man to win either affection or esteem. The Prince
of Wales was also daily becoming more disliked. He was assuming
haughty airs. He was very profligate, and his associates
were mainly actresses and opera girls. The Prussian minister
at London, who was opposed to any matrimonial connection
whatever between the Prussian and the English court, watched
the Prince of Wales very narrowly, and wrote home quite unfavorable
reports respecting his character and conduct. He had
searched out the fact that Fritz had written to his aunt, Queen
Caroline, pledging to her his word “never to marry any body in
the world except the Princess Amelia of England, happen what
will.” This fact was reported to the king, greatly exciting his
wrath.</p>

<p>To obviate the difficulty of the Crown Prince becoming the
head of a party in Berlin antagonistic to the king, the plan was
suggested of having him appointed, with his English princess,
vice-regent of Hanover. But this plan failed. Hotham now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
became quite discouraged. He wrote home, on the 22d of April,
that he had that day dined with the king; that the Crown
Prince was present, but dreadfully dejected, and that great sympathy
was excited in his behalf, as he was so engaging and so
universally popular. He evidently perceived some indications
of superiority in the Crown Prince, for he added, “If I am not
much mistaken, this young prince will one day make a very considerable
figure.”</p>

<p>After much diplomatic toil, the ultimatum obtained from Frederick
William was the ever inflexible answer: “1. The marriage
of the Prince of Wales to Wilhelmina I consent to. 2. The marriage
of the Crown Prince Frederick with the Princess Amelia
must be postponed. I hope it may eventually take place.”</p>

<p>Hotham, quite indignant, sent this dispatch, dated May 13, to
London, including with it a very earnest letter from the Crown
Prince to his uncle, in which Fritz wrote:</p>

<p>“The Crown Prince begs his Britannic majesty not to reject
the king’s proposals, whatever they may be, for his sister Wilhelmina’s
sake. For, though the Crown Prince is determined to
lose his life sooner than marry any body but the Princess Amelia,
yet, if this negotiation were broken off, his father would go
to extremities to force him and his sister into other engagements.”</p>

<p>The return mail brought back, under date of May 22, the
stereotype British answer: “Both marriages or none.” Just before
the reception of this reply, as Colonel Hotham was upon
the eve of leaving Berlin, the Crown Prince addressed to him,
from Potsdam, the following interesting letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,—I believe that it is of the last importance that I
should write to you, and I am very sad to have things to say
which I ought to conceal from all the earth. But one must take
that bad leap, and, reckoning you among my friends, I the more
easily resolve to open myself to you.</p>

<p>“The case is this: I am treated in an unheard of manner by
the king; and I know that there are terrible things in preparation
against me touching certain letters which I wrote last winter,
of which I believe you are informed. In a word, to speak
frankly to you, the real, secret reason why the king will not consent
to this marriage is, that he wishes to keep me on a low footing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
constantly, and to have the power of driving me mad whenever
the whim takes him, throughout his life. Thus he will
never give his consent.</p>

<p>“For my own part, therefore, I believe it would be better to
conclude my sister’s marriage in the first place, and not even to
ask from the king any assurance in regard to mine, the rather as
his word has nothing to do with it. It is enough that I here
reiterate the promises which I have already made to the king,
my uncle, never to take another wife than his second daughter,
the Princess Amelia. I am a person of my word, and shall be
able to bring about what I set forth, provided that there is trust
put in me. I promise it to you. And now you may give your
court notice of it, and I shall manage to keep my promise. I remain
yours always.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In June, 1730, Augustus, King of Poland, had one of the most
magnificent military reviews of which history gives any record.
The camp of Mühlberg, as it was called, was established upon
an undulating field, twelve miles square, on the right bank of
the Elbe, a few leagues below Dresden. It is hardly too much
to say that all the beauty and chivalry of Europe were gathered
upon that field. Fabulous amounts of money and of labor were
expended to invest the scene with the utmost sublimity of splendor.
A military review had great charms for Frederick William.
He attended as one of the most distinguished of the invited
guests. The Crown Prince accompanied the king, as his father
dared not leave him behind. But Fritz was exposed to every
mortification and every species of ignominy which the ingenuity
of this monster parent could heap upon him.</p>

<p>In the presence of monarchs, of lords and ladies, of the highest
dignitaries of Europe, the young heir apparent to the throne of
Prussia, beautiful in person, high-spirited, and of superior genius,
was treated by his father with studied contumely and insult.
Every thing was done to expose him to contempt. He even
openly flogged the prince with his rattan. It would seem that
the father availed himself of this opportunity so to torture the
sensibilities of his son as to drive him to suicide. Professor
Ranke writes:</p>

<p>“In that pleasure-camp of Mühlberg, where the eyes of many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
strangers were directed to him, the Crown Prince was treated
like a disobedient boy, and at one time even with blows, to make
him feel that he was such. The enraged king, who never weighed
the consequences of his words, added mockery to his manual
outrage. ‘Had I been so treated,’ he said, ‘by my father, I would
have blown my brains out. But this fellow has no honor. He
takes all that comes.’”</p>

<p>It would seem that if ever there were an excuse for suicide it
was to be found here. But what folly it would have been!
Dark as these days were, they led the prince to a crown, and to
achievements of whose recital the world will never grow weary.
Fritz, goaded to madness, again adopted the desperate resolve to
attempt an escape. A young Englishman, Captain Guy Dickens,
secretary of the British embassador, Dubourgay, had become
quite the intimate friend of the Crown Prince. They conferred
together upon plans of escape. But the precautions adopted by
the father were such that no plan which they could devise seemed
feasible at that time. Fritz confided his thoughts to his
friend, Lieutenant Keith, at Berlin.</p>

<p>It is probable that the suspicions of the king were excited, for
suddenly he sent Lieutenant Keith to a garrison at Wesel, at a
great distance from Berlin, in a small Prussian province far down
the Rhine. The three had, however, concocted the following
plan, to be subsequently executed. Immediately after the return
from Mühlberg the king was to undertake a long journey
to the Rhine. The Crown Prince, as usual, was to be dragged
along with him. In this journey they would pass through Stuttgart,
within a few miles of Strasbourg, which was on the French
side of the river. From Stuttgart the prince was to escape in
disguise, on fleetest horses, to Strasbourg, and thence proceed to
London. Colonel Hotham, who had accompanied the Prussian
king to the camp of Mühlberg, was apprised of all this by his
secretary. He immediately dispatched the secretary, on the 16th
of June, to convey the confidential intelligence to London.</p>

<p>At the close of these festivities at Mühlberg Frederick William
and his suite took boat down the River Elbe to his hunting palace
at Lichtenberg. Here they killed, in a grand hunting bout,
a thousand animals, boars and deer. The Crown Prince, dishonored
by insults which he could not revenge, and stung to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
quick by innumerable humiliations, followed, dejected, like a
guarded captive, in the train of his father. The unhappy prince
had but just returned to his garrison at Potsdam, where spies
ever kept their eyes vigilantly upon him, when his friend, Captain
Guy Dickens, brought him the answer, returned from London,
to the confidential communication of the Crown Prince to
his uncle, the British king. The substance of the document was
as follows:</p>

<p>“Mr. Guy Dickens may give to the prince the assurance of the
deep compassion which the king feels in view of the sad condition
in which the prince finds himself, and of the sincere desire
of his majesty to aid, by all the means in his power, to extricate
him. While waiting the result of some negotiations now on foot,
his majesty is of the opinion that it would be best for the prince
to defer for a time his present design; that the present critical
state of affairs in Europe do not present a favorable opportunity
for the execution of the contemplated plan; that the idea of retiring
to France demands very careful deliberation; and that
there is not time now to ascertain how such a step would be regarded
by the French court, which his majesty would think to
be essential before he advise a prince so dear to him to withdraw
to that country.”</p>

<p>Soon after this, Colonel Hotham, having received a gross insult
from the king, demanded his passports. The English embassador
had presented the king with a document from his court.
Frederick William angrily threw the paper upon the floor, exclaiming,
“I have had enough of those things!” and, turning
upon his heel, left the room. Colonel Hotham, a high-bred English
gentleman, could not brook such an indignity, not only to
himself, but to his sovereign. The passionate king had scarcely
left the apartment before he perceived the impolicy of his conduct.
He tried to make amends. But Colonel Hotham, justly
regarding it as an insult to his court, persisted in demanding his
passports, and returned to London. The Crown Prince in vain
begged Colonel Hotham to remain. Very properly he replied
that the incivility was addressed to his king, and that it was for
him only to judge what satisfaction was due for the indignity
offered.</p>

<p>All negotiation in reference to the marriages was now apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
at an end. Lieutenant Katte remained at Potsdam. In
the absence of Lieutenant Keith he became more than ever the
friend and confidant of the Crown Prince. Wilhelmina, aware
of the dissipated character of Katte, mourned over this intimacy.
The king was very much annoyed by the blunder of which he
himself had been guilty in insulting the court of England in the
person of its embassador. He declared, in his vexation, that he
would never again treat in person with a foreign minister; that
his hot temper rendered it unsafe for him to do so.</p>

<p>He informed Wilhelmina that the question of her marriage
with the Prince of Wales was now settled forever, and that, as
she declined taking the Duke of Weissenfels for a husband, she
might prepare to retire to the abbey of Hereford, a kind of Protestant
nunnery for ladies of quality, who, for any reason, wished
to be buried from the world. He mercilessly resolved to make
her the abbess of this institution. This living burial was almost
the last situation to suit the taste of Wilhelmina. The king was
in the worst possible humor. “He bullies and outrages his poor
Crown Prince almost worse than ever. There have been rattan
showers hideous to think of, descending this very week (July,
1730) on the fine head and far into the high heart of a royal
young man, who can not in the name of manhood endure, and
must not in the name of sonhood resist, and vainly calls to all
the gods to teach him what he shall do in this intolerable, inextricable
state of affairs.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>As soon as Hotham had left Berlin the Crown Prince held a
secret midnight interview with Captain Dickens and Lieutenant
Katte, to devise some new plan of escape during the journey to
the Rhine, which was to commence in a few days. He made arrangements
to leave all his private papers with Katte, provided
himself with a large gray overcoat as a partial disguise, and,
with much difficulty, obtained about a thousand ducats to defray
his expenses. Lieutenant Keith was at Wesel. He was written
to with the utmost secrecy, as he might be able to render efficient
aid, could the Crown Prince reach him.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 15th of July, 1730, the king, with a small
train, which really guarded Fritz, set out at an early hour from
Potsdam on this memorable journey. Three reliable officers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the king occupied the same carriage with Fritz, with orders to
keep a strict watch over him, and never to leave him alone.
Thus, throughout the journey, one of his guards sat by his side,
and the other two on the seat facing him. The king was not a
luxurious traveler. He seemed to covet hardship and fatigue.
Post-horses were provided all along the route. The meteoric
train rushed along, scarcely stopping for food or sleep, but occasionally
delayed by business of inspection, until it reached Anspach,
where the king’s beautiful daughter, then but sixteen
years of age, resided with her uncongenial husband. Here the
Crown Prince had some hope of escape. He endeavored to persuade
his brother-in-law, the young Marquis of Anspach, to lend
him a pair of saddle-horses, and to say nothing about it. But
the characterless young man, suspecting his brother, and dreading
the wrath of his terrible father-in-law, refused, with many
protestations of good-will.</p>

<p>When near Augsburg, Fritz wrote a letter to Lieutenant Katte,
stating that he should embrace the first opportunity to escape
to the Hague; that there he should assume the name of the
Count of Alberville. He wished Katte to join him there, and
to bring with him the overcoat and the one thousand ducats
which he had left in his hands. On Thursday, August 3d, the
royal party reached the little hamlet of Steinfurth, not far from
the Rhine. Here, as was not unfrequently the case, they slept
in barns, carefully swept and prepared for them. The usual
hour of starting was three o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Just after midnight, the prince, seeing his associates soundly
asleep, cautiously rose, dressed, and crept out into the open air.
He had secretly made arrangements with his valet, a brother of
Lieutenant Keith, to meet him with some horses on the village
green. He reached the green. His valet soon appeared with
the horses. Just at that moment, one of his guard, Rochow, who
had been aroused by a servant whom he had left secretly on the
watch, came forward through the gloom of the night, and, sternly
addressing Keith, inquired, “Sirrah, what are you doing with
those horses?” With much self-possession Keith replied, “I am
getting the horses ready for the hour of starting.” “His majesty,”
Rochow replied, “does not start till five o’clock. Take the
horses directly back to the stable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<div id="ip_90" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_090.jpg" width="456" height="526" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">THE FLIGHT ARRESTED.</div></div>

<p>Keith, trembling in every limb, returned to the stable. Though
Rochow pretended not to suspect any attempt at escape, it was
manifestly pretense only. The prince had provided himself with
a red overcoat as a disguise to his uniform, the gray one having
been left with Katte at Potsdam. As Fritz was returning to
the barn with Rochow, wearing this suspicious garment, they
met the minister Seckendorf, whom Fritz and his mother thoroughly
hated as one of the counselors of the king. Very coolly
and cuttingly Rochow inquired of Seckendorf, “How do you like
his royal highness in the red overcoat?” It was a desperate
game these men were playing; for, should the king suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
die, Fritz would surely inherit the crown, and they would be entirely
at his mercy. All hope of escape seemed now to vanish,
and the prince was quite in despair.</p>

<p>The king was doubtless informed of all that had occurred.
They reached Manheim the next night. Keith was so terrified,
fearing that his life would be the penalty, that he there threw
himself upon his knees before the king, confessing all, and imploring
pardon. The king, in tones of intense agitation, informed
the vigilance trio that death would be their inevitable doom if
they allowed the prince to escape. Thus far the prince had been
nominally free. Those who occupied the carriage with him—Rochow,
Waldau, and Buddenbrock—had assumed to be merely
his traveling companions. Their office of guardship had been
scrupulously concealed. But henceforth he was regarded and
treated as a culprit in the custody of his jailers.</p>

<p>The king, smothering his wrath, did not immediately seek an
interview with his son. But the next day, encountering him, he
said, sarcastically, “Ah! you are still here, then; I thought that
by this time you would have been in Paris.” The prince, somewhat
emboldened by despair, ventured to reply, “I certainly
could have been there had I wished it.”</p>

<p>At Frankfort-on-the-Main the party were to take boats to descend
the river. The prince was informed that the king had
given express orders that he should not be permitted to enter
the town, but that he should be conducted immediately to one
of the royal yachts. Here the king received an intercepted letter
from the Crown Prince to Lieutenant Katte. Boiling with
indignation, he stalked on board the yacht, and assailed his captive
son in the coarsest and most violent language of abuse. In
the frenzy of his passion he seized Fritz by the collar, shook him,
hustled him about, tore out handfuls of hair, and thrust his cane
into his face, causing the blood to gush from his nose. “Never
before,” exclaimed the unhappy prince, pathetically, “did a Brandenburg
face suffer the like of this.”</p>

<p>The king then, having ordered his guard to watch him with
the utmost vigilance, assuring them that their heads should answer
for it if they allowed him to escape, sent his son to another
boat. He was prevailed upon to do so, as no one could tell to
what length the king’s ungovernable passions might lead him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
The royal yachts glided down the Main to the Rhine, and
thence down the Rhine to Wesel. Probably a heavier heart
than that of the prince never floated upon that world-renowned
stream. Lost in painful musings, he had no eye to gaze upon the
picturesque scenes of mountain, forest, castle, and ruins through
which they were gliding. At Bonn he had an interview with
Seckendorf, whose influence was great with his father, and whom
he hoped to interest in his favor. To him he said,</p>

<p>“I intended to have escaped at Steinfurth. I can not endure
the treatment which I receive from my father—his abuse and
blows. I should have escaped long ago had it not been for the
condition in which I should have thus left my mother and sister.
I am so miserable that I care but little for my own life. My
great anxiety is for those officers who have been my friends, and
who are implicated in my attempts. If the king will promise
to pardon them, I will make a full confession of every thing. If
you can help me in these difficulties, I shall be forever grateful
to you.”</p>

<p>It is probable that even Seckendorf was somewhat moved by
this pathetic appeal. Fritz succeeded in sending a letter to the
post-office, addressed to Lieutenant Keith at Wesel, containing
simply the words “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sauvez vous; tout est decouvert</i>” (Save yourself;
all is found out). Keith received the letter but an hour
or so before a colonel of gens d’armes arrived to arrest him.
Seckendorf had an interview with the king, and seems to have
endeavored to mitigate his wrath. He assured the infuriate
monarch of his son’s repentance, and of his readiness to make a
full confession if his father would spare those who had been led
by their sympathies to befriend him. The unrelenting father
received this message very sullenly, saying that he had no faith
that his son would make an honest confession, but that he would
see what he had to say for himself.</p>

<p>At Geldern, when within a few miles of Wesel, the king’s
wrath flamed up anew as he learned that Lieutenant Keith had
escaped. The imperiled young officer, warned of his danger, had
saddled his horse as if for an evening ride in the country. He
passed out at one of the gates of the city, and, riding gently till
darkness came, he put spurs to his horse and escaped to the
Hague. Here, through the friendly offices of Lord Chesterfield,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
the British embassador, he embarked for England. The authorities
there received him kindly, and he entered the British army.
For ten years he was heard of no more. The king dispatched
officers in pursuit of the fugitive, and redoubled the vigilance
with which Fritz was guarded.</p>

<p>Upon the king’s arrival at Wesel he ordered his culprit son to
be brought on shore and to be arraigned before him. It was
Saturday evening, August 12, 1730. A terrible scene ensued.
The despairing Crown Prince, tortured by injustice, was not disposed
to humble himself before his father. Receiving no assurance
that his friends would be pardoned, he evaded all attempts
to extort from him confessions which would implicate them.
General Mosel alone was present at this examination.</p>

<p>“Why,” asked the king, furiously, “did you attempt to desert?”</p>

<p>“I wished to escape,” the prince boldly replied, “because you
did not treat me like a son, but like an abject slave.”</p>

<p>“You are a cowardly deserter,” the father exclaimed, “devoid
of all feelings of honor.”</p>

<p>“I have as much honor as you have,” the son replied; “and I
have only done that which I have heard you say a hundred
times you would have done yourself had you been treated as I
have been.”</p>

<p>The wrath of the king was now ungovernable. He drew his
sword, threatening to thrust it through the heart of his son, and
seemed upon the point of doing so, when General Mosel threw
himself before the king, exclaiming, “Sire, you may kill me, but
spare your son.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>The prince was withdrawn, and placed in a room where two
sentries watched over him with fixed bayonets. The king malignantly
assumed that the prince, being a colonel in the army
and attempting to escape, was a <em>deserter</em>, whose merited doom
was death. General Mosel urged the king not to see his son
again, as his presence was sure to inflame his anger to so alarming
a pitch. The father did not again see him for a year and
three days.</p>

<p>A stern military commission was, however, appointed to interrogate
the prince from questions drawn up by the king. The
examination took place the next day. The prince confessed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
it was his intention to cross the Rhine at the nearest point, and
to repair to Strasbourg, in France. There he intended to enlist
incognito as a volunteer in the French army. He refused to tell
how he obtained his money, or to make any revelations which
would implicate his friends Katte and Keith.</p>

    <div class="caption">FREDERICK WILLIAM ENRAGED.</div></div>

<p>As this report was made to the king, he exclaimed, angrily,
“Let him lie in ward, then, and await the doom which the laws
adjudge to him. He is my colonel. He has attempted to desert.
He has endeavored to induce others to desert with him.
The law speaks plainly enough as to the penalty for such crimes.”</p>

<p>In the mean time, the queen and Wilhelmina, at Berlin, unconscious
of the dreadful tidings they were soon to receive, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
taking advantage of the absence of the king in seeking a few
hours of social enjoyment. They gave a ball at the pretty little
palace of Monbijou, on the banks of the Spree, a short distance
out from Berlin. In the midst of the entertainment the queen
received, by a courier, the following dispatch from Frederick
William:</p>

<p>“I have arrested the rascal Fritz. I shall treat him as his
crime and his cowardice merit. He has dishonored me and all
my family. So great a wretch is no longer worthy to live.”</p>

<p>Wilhelmina, in the following graphic narrative, describes the
scene: “Mamma had given a ball in honor of papa’s birthday.
We recommenced the ball after supper. For six years I had
not danced before. It was new fruit, and I took my fill of it,
without heeding much what was passing. Madam Bulow, who,
with others, had worn long faces all night, pleading illness when
one noticed it, said to me several times,</p>

<p>“‘It is late. I wish you had done.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh dear me!’ I exclaimed; ‘do let me have enough of dancing
this one new time. It may be long before it comes again.’</p>

<p>“She returned to me an hour after, and said, with a vexed air,
‘Will you end, then? You are so engaged you have eyes for
nothing.’</p>

<p>“I replied, ‘You are in such a humor I know not what to
make of it.’</p>

<p>“‘Look at the queen, then,’ she added, ‘and you will cease to
reproach me.’</p>

<p>“A glance which I gave that way filled me with terror. There
sat the queen, in a corner of the room, paler than death, in low
conference with Madam Sonsfeld and Countess Finckenstein.
As my brother was most in my anxieties, I asked if it concerned
him. Madam Bulow shrugged her shoulders, answering, ‘I do
not know at all.’”</p>

<p>They repaired to the carriage, which was immediately ordered.
Not a word was spoken until they reached the palace. Wilhelmina
did not venture to ask any questions. Fearing that her
brother was dead, she was in terrible trepidation. Having arrived
at the palace, Madam Sonsfeld informed her of the contents
of the dispatch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

    <div class="caption">DESTROYING THE LETTERS.</div></div>

<p>The next morning they learned that Lieutenant Katte had
been arrested. All the private papers of Fritz were left, under
Katte’s charge, in a small writing-desk. These letters would
implicate both the mother and the daughter. They were terror-stricken.
Count Finckenstein, who was in high authority, was
their friend. Through him, by the aid of Madam Finckenstein,
they obtained the desk. It was locked and sealed. Despair
stimulated their ingenuity. They succeeded in getting the letters.
To destroy them and leave nothing in their place would
only rouse to greater fury the suspicion and rage of the king.
The letters were taken out and burned. The queen and Wilhelmina
immediately set to work writing new ones, of a very
different character, with which to replace them. For three days
they thus labored almost incessantly, writing between six and
seven hundred letters. They were so careful to avoid any thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
which might lead to detection that paper was employed for each
letter bearing the date of the year in which the letter was supposed
to be written. “Fancy the mood,” writes Carlyle, “of
these two royal women, and the black whirlwind they were in.
Wilhelmina’s dispatch was incredible. Pen went at the gallop
night and day. New letters of old date and of no meaning are
got into the desk again, the desk closed without mark of injury,
and shoved aside while it is yet time.”</p>

<p>Wesel was the fortress of a small province belonging to Prussia,
on the Rhine, many leagues from Berlin. The intervening
territory belonged to Hanover and Hesse Cassel. The king ordered
his captive son to be taken, under a strong guard, by circuitous
roads, so as not to attract attention, to the castle of Mittenwalde,
near Berlin. The king then started for home, probably
as wretched as he was making every body about him. After
a very rapid journey, he reached Berlin late in the afternoon
of Sunday, the 27th of August, 1730. It was the evening after
the fabrication of the letters had been completed. We give, from
the graphic pen of Wilhelmina, the account of the king’s first interview
with his family:</p>

<p>“The queen was alone, in his majesty’s apartment, waiting for
him as he approached. As soon as he saw her at the end of the
suite of rooms, and long before he arrived in the one where she
was, he cried out, ‘Your unworthy son has at last ended himself.
You have done with him.’</p>

<p>“‘What!’ cried the queen, ‘have you had the barbarity to
kill him?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, I tell you,’ the king replied; ‘but I must have his
writing-case.’ For he had already informed himself that it was
in the queen’s possession.</p>

<p>“The queen went to her own apartment to fetch it. I ran in
to her there for a moment. She was out of her senses, wringing
her hands, crying incessantly, and exclaiming, ‘O God, my son,
my son!’ Breath failed me. I fell fainting into the arms of
Madam Sonsfeld. The queen took the writing-desk to the king.
He immediately broke it open and tore out the letters, with
which he went away. The queen came back to us. We were
comforted by the assurance, from some of the attendants, that
my brother at least was not dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
“Pretty soon the king came back, and we, his children, ran to
pay our respects to him, by kissing his hands. But he no sooner
noticed me than rage and fury took possession of him. He
became black in the face, his eyes sparkling fire, his mouth foaming.
‘Infamous wretch!’ said he, ‘dare you show yourself before
me? Go and keep your scoundrel brother company.’</p>

<p>“So saying, he seized me with one hand, striking me several
blows in the face with the other fist. One of the blows struck
me on the temple, so that I fell back, and should have split my
head against a corner of the wainscot had not Madam Sonsfeld
caught me by the head-dress and broken the fall. I lay on the
floor without consciousness. The king, in his frenzy, proceeded
to kick me out of a window which opened to the floor. The
queen, my sisters, and the rest, ran between, preventing him.
They all ranged themselves around me, which gave Mesdames
De Kamecke and Sonsfeld time to pick me up. They put me
in a chair in an embrasure of a window. Madam Sonsfeld supported
my head, which was wounded and swollen with the blows
I had received. They threw water upon my face to bring me
to life, which care I lamentably reproached them with, death being
a thousand times better in the pass things had come to.
The queen was shrieking. Her firmness had entirely abandoned
her. She ran wildly about the room, wringing her hands in
despair. My brothers and sisters, of whom the youngest was
not more than four years old, were on their knees begging for
me. The king’s face was so disfigured with rage that it was
frightful to look upon.</p>

<p>“The king now admitted that my brother was still alive, but
vowed horribly that he would put him to death, and lay me fast
within four walls for the rest of my life. He accused me of being
the prince’s accomplice, whose crime was high treason. ‘I
hope now,’ he said, ‘to have evidence enough to convict the rascal
Fritz and the wretch Wilhelmina, and to cut their heads off.
As for Fritz, he will always, if he lives, be a worthless fellow.
I have three other sons, who will all turn out better than he has
done.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, spare my brother,’ I cried, ‘and I will marry the Duke
of Weissenfels.’ But in the great noise he did not hear me.
And while I strove to repeat it louder, Madam Sonsfeld clapped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
her handkerchief on my mouth. Pushing aside to get rid of the
handkerchief, I saw Katte crossing the square. Four soldiers
were conducting him to the king. My brother’s trunks and his
were following in the rear. Pale and downcast, he took off his
hat to salute me. He fell at the king’s feet imploring pardon.”</p>

    <div class="caption">WILHELMINA IMPRISONED.</div></div>

<p>The king kicked him, and struck him several heavy blows
with his cane. He was hit repeatedly in the face, and blood
gushed from the wounds. With his own hands the king tore
from Katte’s breast the cross of the Order of Saint John. After
this disgraceful scene the interrogatory commenced. Katte confessed
all the circumstances of the prince’s intended escape, but
denied that there had been any design against the king or the
state. His own and the prince’s letters were examined, but
nothing was found in them to criminate either. Katte was then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
remanded to prison. Wilhelmina, after receiving the grossest
possible insults from her father, who accused her, in coarsest
terms, of being the paramour of Lieutenant Katte, was ordered
to her room. Two sentries were placed at her door, and directions
were given that she should be fed only on prison fare.</p>

<p>“Tell your unworthy daughter,” said the king to the queen,
“that her room is to be her prison. I shall give orders to have
the guard there doubled. I shall have her examined in the
most rigorous manner, and will afterward have her removed to
some fit place, where she may repent of her crimes.”</p>

<p>The whole city of Berlin was agitated by the rumor of these
events. The violent scene in the palace had taken place in an
apartment on the ground floor. The loud and angry tones of
the king, the shrieks of the queen, the cries of the children, the
general clamor, had so attracted the attention of the passers-by
that a large crowd had assembled before the windows. It was
necessary to call out the guard to disperse them. Difficult as it
was to exaggerate outrages so infamous, still they were exaggerated.
The report went to all foreign courts that the king, in his
ungovernable rage, had knocked down the Princess Wilhelmina
and trampled her to death beneath his feet.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">The</span> captive Crown Prince was conveyed from Wesel to the
castle of Mittenwalde, where he was imprisoned in a room without
furniture or bed. An old chest which chanced to be there
was his only seat. One of the king’s favorite ministers, Grumkow,
with other officials, was sent to interrogate him. The
prince, probably aware that nothing which he could now do
could make matters worse than they actually were, displayed
much spirit in the interview. Frankly avowing his intention to
escape, he refused to make any disclosures which should implicate
his friends. Grumkow insolently informed him that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
use of the rack was not yet abolished in his majesty’s dominions,
and that, if he were not more pliant, the energies of that instrument
might be called into requisition. Frederick admitted afterward
that his blood ran cold at that suggestion. Still he had
the nerve to reply, according to the testimony of Wilhelmina,</p>

<p>“A hangman such as you naturally takes pleasure in talking
of his tools and of his trade, but on me they will produce no
effect. I have owned every thing, and almost regret to have
done so. I ought not to degrade myself by answering the questions
of a scoundrel such as you are.”</p>

<p>Grumkow gathered up his papers, and, with his associate officials,
departed, probably meditating upon his own prospects
should the Crown Prince ever become King of Prussia. The
next day, September 5, the captive was taken from the castle of
Mittenwalde, and sent to the fortress of Cüstrin, a small and
quiet town about seventy miles from Berlin. The strong, dungeon-like
room in which he was incarcerated consisted of bare
walls, without any furniture, the light being admitted by a single
aperture so high that the prince could not look out at it.
He was divested of his uniform, of his sword, of every mark of
dignity.</p>

<p>Coarse brown clothes of plainest cut were furnished him. His
flute was taken from him, and he was deprived of all books but
the Bible and a few devotional treatises. He was allowed a
daily sum, amounting to twelve cents of our money, for his food—eight
cents for his dinner and four for his supper. His food
was purchased at a cook-shop near by, and cut for him. He was
not permitted the use of a knife. The door was opened three
times a day for ventilation—morning, noon, and night—but not
for more than four minutes each time. A single tallow-candle
was allowed him; but that was to be extinguished at seven
o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p>Thus deprived of all the ordinary comforts of life, the prince,
in the nineteenth year of his age, was consigned to an imprisonment
of absolute solitude. For weeks and months he was left
to his own agitating thoughts, with the apparent blighting of
every earthly hope, awaiting whatever doom his merciless father
might award to him. His jailers, not unmindful of the embarrassing
fact that their captive might yet become King of Prussia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
with their fate in his hands, gradually treated him with all
the secret kindness which they dared to exhibit.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

    <div class="caption">FREDERICK IN PRISON.</div></div>

<p>Though Wilhelmina was also a close prisoner in her apartment
in the Berlin palace, and was fed upon the coarsest fare, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
still had a comfortable room, her musical instruments, and the
companionship of her governess, Madam Sonsfeld. It was rather
a relief to the unhappy princess to be shut out from the presence
of her father and from the sound of his voice. She occasionally
obtained a smuggled letter from her mother, and even got
one, in pencil, from her brother, full of expressions of tenderness.</p>

<p>All the friends of Fritz were treated by the infuriate father
with the most cruel severity. No mercy was shown to any one
who had ever given the slightest indication of sympathy with
the Crown Prince. A bookseller, who had furnished Fritz with
French books, was cruelly exiled to the remote shores of the
Baltic, on the extreme northern frontiers of Prussia. A French
gentleman, Count Montholieu, who had loaned the Crown Prince
money, would probably have perished upon the scaffold had he
not escaped by flight. His effigy was nailed to the gallows.</p>

<p>There was a young lady in Potsdam by the name of Doris
Ritter. She was the daughter of highly respectable parents,
and was of unblemished character. As Fritz was extremely fond
of music, and she played sweetly on the harpsichord, he loaned
her pieces of music, and occasionally, under the eye of her parents,
accompanied her with the flute. The life of a colonel in
garrison at Potsdam was so dull, that this innocent amusement
was often quite a help in beguiling the weary hours.</p>

<p>The young lady was not beautiful, and there was no evidence
of the slightest improprieties, or of any approach even to flirtation.
But the infuriate king, who, without the shadow of reason,
could accuse his own daughter of infamy, caused this young
lady, under the pretext that she had been the guilty intimate of
his son, to be taken from her parents, to be delivered to the executioners,
and to be publicly conveyed in a cart and whipped on
the bare back through the principal streets of the town. She
was then imprisoned, and doomed to beat hemp as a culprit for
three years.</p>

<p>One’s faith in a superintending Providence is almost staggered
by such outrages. It would seem that there could scarcely be
any compensation even in the future world for so foul a wrong
inflicted upon this guileless and innocent girl. There can be no
possible solution of the mystery but in the decree, “After death
cometh the judgment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

    <div class="caption">DORIS RITTER’S PUNISHMENT.</div></div>

<p>“It is impossible,” writes Lord Dover, “not to perceive that
the real reason of his conduct was his enmity to his son, and
that the crime of the poor girl was the having assisted in making
the son’s existence more supportable. The intention of Frederick
William apparently being that the infliction of so infamous
a punishment in so public a manner should prevent the
possibility of Frederick’s ever seeing her again.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>A court-martial was convened to pronounce sentence upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
Crown Prince and his confederates. The court was appointed
by the king, and consisted of three major generals, three colonels,
three lieutenant colonels, three majors, three captains, and three
belonging to the civil courts, called auditors. The court, thus
composed of eighteen members, met on the 20th of October, 1730,
in the little town of Copenick, a few miles from Berlin. Grumkow,
well aware that these proceedings would attract the attention
of every court in Europe, had persuaded the king to submit
to the formality of a court-martial.</p>

<p>It was well understood that a verdict was to be returned in
accordance with the wishes of the king, and also that the king
desired that no mercy should be shown to his son.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> After a
session of six days the verdict of the court was rendered. The
crime of the Crown Prince, in endeavoring to escape from the
brutality of his father, was declared to be <em>desertion</em>, and the penalty
was death. Lieutenant Keith was also declared to be a deserter,
and doomed to die. But as he had escaped, and could
not be recaptured, he was sentenced to be hanged in effigy, which
effigy was then to be cut in four quarters and nailed to the gallows
at Wesel. Lieutenant Katte, who certainly had not deserted,
and whose only crime was that he had been a confidant of
the Crown Prince in his plan to escape, was condemned to imprisonment
in a fortress for two years, some say for life.</p>

<p>The king approved of the first two sentences of the court.
The mildness of the last roused his indignation. “Katte,” he
exclaimed, “is guilty of high treason. He shall die by the
sword of the headsman. It is better that he should die than
that justice depart out of the world.” His doom was thus fixed
as irreversible as fate.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the young man’s mother, she was in her grave.
His father was at that time commandant of Königsberg, in high
favor with the king. His illustrious grandfather on his mother’s
side, Field-marshal Wartensleben, was still living. For half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
a century he had worthily occupied the most eminent posts of
honor. The tears, the agonizing entreaties of these friends were
not of the slightest avail. The king’s heart was as impervious
to appeals for mercy as are the cliffs of Sinai.</p>

<p>There are several letters still remaining which Lieutenant
Katte wrote to his friends during those hours of anguish in
which he was awaiting his death. No one can read them without
compassionate emotion, and without execrating the memory
of that implacable tyrant who so unjustly demanded his execution.
The young man wrote to the king a petition containing
the following pathetic plea:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sire</span>,—It is not to excuse myself that I address this letter to
your majesty; but, moved by sincere repentance and heartfelt
sorrow, I implore your clemency, and beseech you, sire, to have
some consideration for my youth, which renders me capable of
imprudence without any bad design.</p>

<p>“God does not always follow the impulse of his justice toward
sinners, but often, by his mercy, reclaims those who have
gone astray. And will not your majesty, sire, who are a resemblance
of the divinity, pardon a criminal who is guilty of disobedience
to his sovereign? The hope of pardon supports me, and
I flatter myself that your majesty will not cut me off in the flower
of my age, but will give me time to prove the effect your majesty’s
clemency will have on me.</p>

<p>“Sire, I own that I am guilty. Will not your majesty grant
me a pardon, which God never refuses to the greatest sinner who
sincerely confesses his sins? I shall be always ready to shed
even the last drop of my blood to show your majesty what grateful
sentiments your clemency can raise in me.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It was all in vain. On Sunday evening, September 5th, as the
condemned young man was sitting alone in his prison cell, sadly
awaiting his doom, yet clinging to hopes of mercy, an officer entered
with the startling intelligence that the carriage was at the
door to convey him to the fortress of Cüstrin, at a few leagues
distance, where he was to be executed. For a moment he was
greatly agitated. He soon, however, regained his equanimity.
It must indeed have been a fearful communication to one in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
vigor of health, in the prime of youth, and surrounded by every
thing which could render life desirable. Two brother-officers
and the chaplain accompanied him upon this dismal midnight
ride. Silence, pious conversation, prayers, and occasional devotional
hymns occupied the hours. The dawn of a cold winter’s
morning was just appearing as they reached the fortress.</p>

<p>His companions had no heart to witness the bloody execution
of their friend and brother-officer. The chaplain, Müller, who
had accompanied the condemned to Cüstrin, and also Besserer,
the chaplain of the garrison there, were either obliged by their
official position, or were constrained by Christian sympathy, to
ride by his side in the death-cart to the scaffold. Of the rest of
his friends he took an affectionate leave, saying, “Adieu, my
brothers; may God be with you evermore!” He was conveyed
to the rampart of the castle dressed in coarse brown garments
precisely like those worn by the prince.</p>

<p>By order of the king, Fritz, who had also been condemned to
die and was awaiting his doom, was brought down into a lower
room of the fortress, before whose window the scaffold was erected,
that he might be compelled “to see Katte die.” At his entrance
the curtains were closed, shutting out the view of the
court-yard. Upon the drawing of the curtains, Fritz, to his horror,
beheld the scaffold draped in black on a level with the window,
and directly before it.</p>

<p>The unhappy Crown Prince was in an agony of despair.
Again and again he frantically exclaimed, “In the name of God,
I beg you to stop the execution till I write to the king! I am
ready to renounce all my rights to the crown if he will pardon
Katte!” As the condemned was led by the window to ascend
the scaffold, Fritz cried out to him, in anguish as intense as a
generous heart can endure, “Pardon me, my dear Katte, pardon
me! Oh that this should be what I have done for you!”</p>

<p>A smile flitted across Katte’s pallid features as he replied,
“Death is sweet for a prince I love so well.” With fortitude
he ascended the scaffold. The executioner attempted to bandage
his eyes, but he resisted, and, looking to heaven, said, “Father,
into thy hands I surrender my soul!” Four grenadiers
held Fritz with his face toward the window. Fainting, he fell
senseless upon the floor. At the same moment, by a single blow,
Katte’s head rolled upon the scaffold. As the prince recovered
consciousness, he found himself still at the window, in full view
of the headless and gory corpse of his friend. Another swoon
consigned him to momentary unconsciousness.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

    <div class="caption">FREDERICK AT KATTE’S EXECUTION.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
The body of Katte remained upon the scaffold during the
short wintry day, and at night was buried in one of the bastions
of the fortress. This cruel tragedy was enacted more than a
century ago; but there are few who even now can read the record
without having their eyes flooded, through the conflicting
emotions of sympathy for the sufferers and indignation against
the tyrant who could perpetrate such crimes.</p>

<p>When Frederick returned to consciousness his misery plunged
him into a high fever. Delirium ensued, during which Chaplain
Müller, who remained with him, says that he frequently attempted
to destroy himself. As the fever abated and he became more
tranquil, floods of tears gushed from his eyes. He for some time
refused to take any nourishment. It seemed to him now that
every hope in life was forever blighted. He had no doubt that
his own death was fully decided upon, and that he would soon
be led to his execution. In his moments of delirious anguish he
at times longed for death to come as speedily as possible. And
again it seemed awful to have his young life—for he was then
but eighteen years of age—cut off by the bloody sword.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Chaplain Müller seems to have enjoyed the confidence of the
king to an unusual decree. He was ordered to remain at Cüstrin,
and to have daily interviews with the prince, to instruct
him in religion. The king professed to be eminently a religious
man. While torturing the body and the mind of the prince in
every way, he expressed great anxiety for the salvation of his
soul. It is not strange that the example of such a father had
staggered the faith of the son. Illogically he renounced that religion
which condemned, in the severest terms, the conduct of
the father, and which caused the king often to tremble upon his
throne, appalled by the declaration, “Know thou that for all
these things God will bring thee into judgment.”</p>

<p>The young prince had also become dissolute in life. The sacred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
volume denounced such a career as offensive to God, as sure
to bring down upon the guilty prince the divine displeasure in
this life, and, if unrepented of, in the life to come. No man who
believes the Bible to be true can, with any comfort whatever, indulge
in sin. The prince wished to indulge his passions without
restraint. He therefore, thus living, found it to be a necessity
to renounce that religion which arrayed against his sinful
life all the terrors of the final judgment. A wicked life and true
Christian faith can not live in peace together. The one or the
other must be abandoned. Frederick chose to abandon Christian
faith.</p>

<p>It seems that the Crown Prince had an inquiring mind. He
was interested in metaphysical speculations. He had adopted,
perhaps, as some excuse for his conduct, the doctrine of predestination,
that God hath foreordained whatsoever cometh to pass.
The idea that there is a power, which Hume calls philosophical
necessity, which Napoleon calls destiny, which Calvin calls predestination,
by which all events are controlled, and that this necessity
is not inconsistent with free agency, is a doctrine which
ever has commanded the assent, and probably ever will, of many
of the strongest thinkers in the world.</p>

<p>“The heresy about predestination,” writes Carlyle, “or the
election by free grace, as his majesty terms it, according to which
a man is preappointed, from all eternity, either to salvation or
the opposite, which is Fritz’s notion, and indeed Calvin’s, and
that of many benighted creatures, this editor among them, appears
to his majesty an altogether shocking one. What! may
not deserter Fritz say to himself, even now, or in whatever other
deeps of sin he may fall into, ‘I was foredoomed to it? How
could I or how can I help it?’ The mind of his majesty shudders
as if looking over the edge of an abyss.”</p>

<p>Chaplain Müller was especially directed to argue with Frederick
upon this point, and, if possible, to convert him to Christianity.
The correspondence which ensued between the king
and Müller is preserved. The king wrote to the chaplain, under
date of November 3d, 1730:</p>

<p>“I have been assured that you are an honest and pious clergyman,
and a faithful minister of the Word of God. Since, therefore,
you are going to Cüstrin, on account of the execution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
Lieutenant Katte, I command you, after the execution, to pay a
visit to the Prince Royal; to reason with him and to represent
to him that whosoever abandons God is also abandoned by God;
and that, when God has abandoned a man, and has taken away
his grace from him, that man is incapable of doing what is good,
and can only do what is evil. You will exhort him to repent,
and to ask pardon for the many sins he has committed, and into
which he has seduced others, one of whom has been just punished
with death.</p>

<p>“If you then find the prince contrite and humble, you will engage
him to fall on his knees with you, to ask pardon of God
with tears of penitence. But you must proceed with prudence
and circumspection, for the prince is cunning. You will represent
to him also, in a proper manner, the error he labors under
in believing that some are predestinated to one thing and some
to another; and that thus he who is predestinated to evil can
do nothing but evil, and he who is predestinated to good can do
nothing but good, and that, consequently, we can change nothing
of what is to happen—a dreadful error, especially in what regards
our salvation.</p>

<p>“Now, as I hope that his present situation, and the execution
which has just taken place before his eyes, will touch and soften
his heart, and will lead him to better sentiments, I charge you,
as you value your conscience, to do all that is humanly possible
to represent forcibly to the prince these things; and particularly,
in what relates to predestination, to convince him by means of
passages from the Scriptures which satisfactorily prove what I
wish you to advance.”</p>

<p>This letter was addressed to the “reverend, well-beloved,
and faithful Müller,” and was signed “your affectionate king.”
Though the king had not yet announced any intention of sparing
the life of his son, and probably was fully resolved upon his
execution, he was manifestly disturbed by the outcry against
his proceedings raised in all the courts of Europe. Three days
before the king wrote the above letter, the Emperor of Germany,
Charles VI., had written to him, with his own hand, earnestly
interceding for the Crown Prince. In addition to the letter, the
emperor, through his minister Seckendorf, had presented a very
firm remonstrance. He announced to Frederick William that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Prince Frederick was a prince of the empire, and that he was
entitled to the protection of the laws of the Germanic body; that
the heir-apparent of the Prussian monarchy was under the safeguard
of the Germanic empire, and that the king was bound to
surrender to this tribunal the accused, and the documents relative
to this trial.</p>

<p>The emperor was probably induced to this decisive course
not merely by motives of humanity, but also by the consideration
that by thus saving the life of Frederick he would forever
attach him to the interests of the house of Austria. The kings
of Poland and Sweden also wrote to the king, earnestly interceding
for the life of the Crown Prince.</p>

<p>The king was at first much incensed by these attempts at interference.
It was not safe for him to bid defiance to the opinions
of the civilized world. Emotions of anger and mortification
struggled in the bosom of the king. Captain Guy Dickens, secretary
of Dubourgay, writes:</p>

<p>“The King of Prussia can not sleep. The officers sit up with
him every night, and in his slumbers he raves and talks of spirits
and apparitions.”</p>

<p>He drank deeply, wandering about by night as if possessed
by fiends. “He has not,” writes Captain Dickens, “gone to bed
sober for a month past.” Once he rose, about midnight, and,
with a candle in his hand, entered the apartment of the queen,
apparently in a state of extreme terror, saying that there was
something haunting him. His agitation was so great that a bed
was made up for him there.</p>

<p>Two days after the death of Katte, the king wrote to Chaplain
Müller, under date of November 7th, 1730, a letter closing
with the following words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“As God often, by wondrous guidance, strange paths, and
thorny steps, will bring men into the kingdom of Christ, so may
our divine Redeemer help that this prodigal son be brought
into his communion; that his godless heart be beaten until it is
softened and changed, and so he be snatched from the claws of
Satan. This grant us, the Almighty God and Father, for our
Lord Jesus Christ and his passion and death’s sake. Amen.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“I am, for the rest, your well-affectioned king,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Frederick William</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
The prince supposed that the object of Muller’s visits was to
prepare him for his death. But upon receiving the full assurance
that his father contemplated pardoning him, should there
be evidence of repentance, he promised to take an oath of entire
submission to his father’s will. Seven commissioners were sent
to the prison of Cüstrin, on the 19th of November, to administer
this oath with the utmost solemnity. He was conducted to the
church. A large crowd was in attendance. A sermon appropriate
to the occasion was preached. The sacrament of the Lord’s
Supper was administered to him. And then he audibly repeated
the oath and attached to it his signature.</p>

<p>From the church the prince was conducted, not back to his
prison in the fortress, but to a town mansion, which was assigned
as his residence. His sword was restored to him. But he was
still not fully liberated. Officials, appointed by his father, surrounded
him, who watched and reported all his movements.
The first act of the young prince, upon reaching his apartment
after this partial liberation, was to write as follows to his father.
We give the letter as translated by Carlyle:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
“Cüstrin, November 19, 1730.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">All-serenest and All-graciousest Father</span>,—To your royal
majesty, my all-graciousest Father, I have, by my disobedience as
Their subject and soldier, not less than by my undutifulness as
Their son, given occasion to a just wrath and aversion against
me. With the all-obedientest respect I submit myself wholly
to the grace of my most All-gracious Father, and beg him most
All-graciously to pardon me, as it is not so much the withdrawal
of my liberty, in a sad arrest, as my own thoughts of the fault I
have committed that have brought me to reason, who, with all-obedientest
respect and submission, continue till my end my All-graciousest
king’s and Father’s faithfully-obedientest servant and
son,</p>

<p>Here, in the little town of Cüstrin, in a house very meagerly
furnished, the Crown Prince established his household upon the
humblest scale. The prince was allowed to wear his sword, but
not his uniform. He was debarred all amusements, and was
forbidden to read, write, or speak French. To give him employment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
he was ordered to attend regularly the sittings of the
Chamber of Counselors of that district, though he was to take
his seat as the youngest member. Three persons were appointed
constantly to watch over him. Lord Dover writes:</p>

<p>“His diet was regulated at a sum which made it barely sufficient
to prevent actual starvation. His apartment was most
miserable, and almost entirely devoid of furniture. He was in
great want of linen, and of others of the first necessaries of life.
At nine o’clock at night his candle was taken from him, while
pen, ink, paper, and books were alike denied him.”</p>

<p>“His very flute,” Carlyle writes, “most innocent ‘Princess,’ as
he used to call his flute in old days, is denied him ever since he
came to Cüstrin. But by degrees he privately gets her back, and
consorts much with her; wails forth, in beautiful adagios, emotions
for which there is no other utterance at present. He has
liberty of Cüstrin and the neighborhood. Out of Cüstrin he is
not to lodge any night without leave had of the commandant.”</p>

<p>While these sad scenes were transpiring, the Princess Wilhelmina
was held in close captivity in her apartment at the palace
in Berlin. The king had convened a council of eight clergymen,
and had put to them the question whether a father had not a
right to give his daughter in wedlock to whom he pleased.
Much to the honor of these clergymen, they replied, with but one
exception, in the negative.</p>

<p>The queen remained firm in her determination that Wilhelmina
should marry the Prince of Wales. The king was equally
inflexible in his resolve that she should not marry the Prince of
Wales. The queen occasionally had interviews with Wilhelmina,
when they wept together over their disappointments and
trials. The spirited young princess had no special predilections
for the English prince, but she was firm in her resolve not to
have a repugnant husband forced upon her. On the night of
the 27th of January, 1731, as the queen was about to leave Berlin
for Potsdam, she said to her daughter,</p>

<p>“Be firm, my child. Trust in my management. Only swear
to me, on your eternal salvation, that never, on any compulsion,
will you marry another than the Prince of Wales. Give me that
oath.”</p>

<p>But Wilhelmina evaded the oath upon the ground of religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
scruples. Anxiety, confinement, and bad diet had so preyed upon
her health that she was reduced almost to a skeleton. The following
extract from her journal gives a graphic account of her
painful condition:</p>

<p>“I was shut up in my bedchamber, where I saw nobody, and
continued always to fast. I was really dying of hunger. I read
as long as there was daylight, and made remarks upon what I
read. My health began to give way. I became as thin as a
skeleton from want of food and exercise. One day Madam De
Sonsfeld and myself were at table, looking sadly at one another,
having nothing to eat but soup made with salt and water, and a
ragout of old bones, full of hairs and other dirt, when we heard
a knocking at the window. Surprised, we rose hastily to see
what it was. We found a raven with a morsel of bread in its
beak, which it laid down on the sill of the window so soon as it
saw us, and flew away. Tears came into our eyes at this adventure.
‘Our lot is very deplorable,’ said I to my governess, ‘since
it even touches the creatures devoid of reason. They have more
compassion for us than men, who treat us with so much cruelty.’”</p>

<p>The raven was a tame one, which had got lost and was seeking
for its home. The story, however, spread, and created great
sympathy for the imprisoned princess. There was a large number
of French refugees in Berlin. With characteristic kindness,
at the risk of incurring the royal displeasure, they sent daily a
basket of food, which was placed in a situation from which Wilhelmina’s
maids could easily convey the contents to her, while
compassionate sentries kindly looked the other way. The princess
wrote to her father, imploring permission to receive the sacrament,
from which she had been debarred for nearly a year.
The reply from her-father was couched in the following terms:</p>

<p>“My blackguard daughter may receive the sacrament.”</p>

<p>Her sisters were now permitted occasionally to visit her, and
her situation became somewhat ameliorated. On the 10th of
May Wilhelmina received a letter from her mother which caused
her to wring her hands in anguish. It informed her that the
next day a deputation was to call upon her from the king, to insist
upon her giving her consent to marry the Prince of Baireuth.</p>

<p>The letter was as follows:</p>

<p>“All is lost, my dear daughter. The king is determined, at
all hazards, upon your marriage. I have sustained several dreadful
contests on this subject, but neither my prayers nor my tears
have had any effect. Eversman has orders to make the purchases
necessary for your marriage. You must prepare yourself
to lose Madam Sonsfeld. The king is determined to have her
degraded with infamy if you do not obey him. Some one will
be sent to persuade you. In God’s name consent to nothing, and
God will support you in it. A prison is better than a bad marriage.
Adieu, my dear daughter! I expect every thing from
your firmness.”</p>

    <div class="caption">GRUMKOW’S CONFERENCE WITH WILHELMINA.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
A deputation of four ministers, headed by Baron Grumkow,
the next day presented themselves to the princess. To overawe
Wilhelmina, they approached her with all the solemnity of state.
Grumkow opened the conference:</p>

<p>“Obey the wishes of the king,” said he, “and the royal favor
will be restored to you. Refuse to do it, and no one can tell
what will be the doom which will fall upon your mother, your
brother, and yourself.”</p>

<p>They all united their entreaties, arguments, prayers, and
threats. The princess was in a state of terrible agitation. Almost
distracted she paced the floor. That she might have a little
time to reflect, the four deputies retired into the recess of a
window. One of them, M. Tulmier, then approached the princess,
and, in a low tone of voice, said to her,</p>

<p>“Do not resist any longer. Submit to whatever is required
of you. I will answer with my life that the marriage will never
really take place. It is necessary, at whatever cost, to appease
the king for the present. I will explain to the queen that this
is the only means of obtaining a favorable declaration from the
King of England.”</p>

<p>Thus influenced, she yielded. Tears flooded her eyes, and her
voice was broken with sobs as she said, “I am ready to sacrifice
myself for the peace of the family.” The deputation withdrew,
leaving the princess in despair. Baron Grumkow conveyed to
the king the pleasing intelligence of her submission.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">Wilhelmina,</span> having thus given her very reluctant assent to
her marriage with the Prince of Baireuth, wrote as follows to
her mother:</p>

<p>“I have hardly strength enough to trace these lines. My state
is altogether worthy of pity. It is not through any menaces,
however violent they may have been, that I have yielded my
consent to the king’s wishes. An interest still more dear to me
has determined me to this sacrifice. I have been till now the
innocent cause of all the unhappiness which your majesty has
endured. My too sensible heart has been penetrated by the
touching details you have latterly made of them.</p>

<p>“You have been willing to suffer for me. Is it not much more
natural that I should sacrifice myself for you, and that I should
finish, once for all, this fatal division in the family? Could I
balance a moment between the choice of unhappiness for myself
and the pardon of my brother? What dreadful discourses have
there not been held to me on this subject! I tremble when I
think of them. All the objections I could allege against the
king’s proposal were refuted to me beforehand. Your majesty
yourself had proposed to him the Prince of Baireuth as a fit alliance
for me. I can not therefore imagine that you will disapprove
of my resolution. Besides, necessity is not to be resisted.
I shall have the honor to offer a more circumstantial detail of
the whole transaction to your majesty when I shall be permitted
to throw myself at your feet. I can understand easily what
must be your grief on the occasion. It is that which touches
me the most.”</p>

<p>The king, in response to the report of Baron Grumkow, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
was so gratifying to him, sent the same evening the following
note to Wilhelmina:</p>

<p>“I am delighted, my dear Wilhelmina, that you are so submissive
to the wishes of your father. The good God will bless you
for it; and I will never abandon you. I will take care of you
all my life, and will endeavor to prove to you that I am your
very affectionate father.”</p>

<p>The next morning the princess received the following cruel
epistle from her mother:</p>

<p>“You have cut me to the heart, and have inflicted on me the
greatest misery I ever endured. I had placed all my hope in
you, in consequence of my ignorance of your character. You
have had the address to disguise to me the bad propensities of
your heart, and the baseness of your disposition. I repent a
thousand times the kindness I have shown you, the care I have
taken of your education, and all that I have suffered on your account.
I no longer acknowledge you as my daughter, and shall,
in future, never regard you but as my most cruel enemy, since
it is you who have sacrificed me to my persecutors, who now triumph
over me. Never count upon me again. I vow eternal
hatred to you, and will never forgive you.”</p>

<p>Soon after, the king returned to Berlin and summoned his
daughter to his presence. He received her very graciously.
The queen, however, remained quite unreconciled, and was loud
in the expression of her anger: “I am disgraced, vanquished,
and my enemies are triumphant!” she exclaimed. Her chagrin
was so great that she fell quite sick. To a few words of sympathy
which her child uttered, she replied, “Why do you pretend
to weep? It is you who have killed me.”</p>

<p>Frederick William was in high spirits. Many distinguished
strangers were invited to his court, and they were received with
great magnificence. There were costly and showy entertainments,
served by “six-and-twenty blackamoors,” bands of music,
with much pomp of etiquette, and reviews of the giant guard
and of the marvelously drilled army. Preparations were made
for a review of great splendor on Monday, the 28th of May.
The Prince of Baireuth was invited, though neither the queen
nor Wilhelmina were aware of it. At the early hour of seven
o’clock of the preceding evening the king went to bed, that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
might be fresh for the review on the morrow. His high-born
guests were left to be entertained by the queen and the princess.
Just as they were passing in to supper, the sound of carriage
wheels, approaching the foot of the grand staircase, was heard in
the court-yard. As that was an honor conferred only upon
princes, the queen was a little surprised, and sent to inquire who
had arrived. To her consternation, she found that it was the
Prince of Baireuth.</p>

<p>“The head of Medusa,” writes the princess, “never produced
such horror as did this piece of news to the queen. For some
time she could not utter a word, and changed color so often that
we thought she would faint. Her state went to my heart. I
remained as immovable as she. Every one present appeared
full of consternation.”</p>

<p>The prince retired to his chamber, to be presented to the royal
family at the review the next day. Wilhelmina passed a
miserable night. She could not sleep, and in the morning found
herself so ill that she begged to be excused from the review.
She also greatly dreaded encountering the coarse jests of her father.
But she could not be released from the review. Both
she and her mother were compelled to go. In an open carriage,
the queen and princess, with attendant ladies of the court, passed
before the line. The Marquis of Schwedt, whom the princess
had so emphatically discarded, was at the head of his regiment.
He seemed “swollen with rage,” and saluted the royal party
with his eyes turned away. The royal carriages were then withdrawn
to a little distance that the ladies might witness the spectacle.</p>

<p>“Such a show for pomp and circumstance, Wilhelmina owns,
as could not be equaled in the world; such wheeling, rhythmic
coalescing and unfolding, accurate as clock-work, far and wide;
swift, big column here hitting big column there at the appointed
place and moment; with their volleyings and trumpetings,
bright uniforms, and streamers, and field-music, in equipment
and manœuvre perfect all, to the meanest drummer or black kettle-drummer;
supreme drill sergeant playing on the thing as on
his huge piano, several square miles in area.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>As the ladies of the court were gazing upon this spectacle, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
officer rode up to the royal carriage, cap in hand, and said that
he was directed to present to the queen and princess his Highness
the Prince of Baireuth. Immediately a tall young man, in
rich dress and of very courtly air, rode up to the carriage and
saluted his future mother and his destined bride. His reception
was very chilling. The queen, with frigid civility, scarcely recognized
his low bow. Wilhelmina, faint from fasting, anxiety,
and sleeplessness, was so overcome by her emotions that she fell
back upon her seat in a swoon.</p>

<p>Wilhelmina had never seen the Prince of Wales. Her mother
had not attempted to conceal from her that he was exceedingly
plain in person, slightly deformed, weak in intellect, and debased
by his debaucheries. But the ambitious queen urged
these considerations, not as objections, but as incentives to the
marriage. “You will be able,” she said, “to have him entirely
under your direction. You will thus be virtually King of England,
and can exert a powerful control over all the nations of
Europe.” These considerations, however, did not influence the
princess so much as they did her mother. She had never taken
any special interest in her marriage with the Prince of Wales.
Indeed, at times, she had said that nothing should ever induce
her to marry him.</p>

<p>The first glance at the Prince of Baireuth prepossessed the
princess in his favor. She subsequently, when better acquainted
with him, described him in the following terms:</p>

<p>“The prince is tall, well made, and has a noble air. His features
are neither handsome nor regular; but his countenance,
which is open, engaging, and very agreeable, stands him in the
place of beauty. He is of a hasty temper, and replies with
quickness and without embarrassment. Though his nature is
inclined to anger, he knows so well how to overcome it that it
is never perceived, and no one has ever suffered by it. He is
very gay. His conversation is very agreeable, though he has
some difficulty in making himself intelligible from lisping so
much. His conception is quick, and his intellect penetrating.
The goodness of his heart gains him the attachment of all who
know him. He is generous, charitable, compassionate, polite, engaging,
and enjoys very equal spirits. The only fault I know in
him is too much levity, which I must mention here, as otherwise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
I should be accused of partiality. He has, however, much corrected
himself of it.”</p>

<p>The next Sunday, June 3d, the betrothal took place with great
magnificence. The ceremony was attended by a large concourse
of distinguished guests. Lord Dover says that the very evening
of the day of the betrothing a courier arrived from England with
dispatches announcing that the English court had yielded to all
the stipulations demanded by the King of Prussia in reference
to the marriage of Wilhelmina to the Prince of Wales. It was
now too late to retract. Probably both the king and Wilhelmina
were gratified in being able to decline the offer. But the
chagrin of the queen was terrible. She fell into a violent fever,
and came near dying, reproaching her daughter with having
killed her.</p>

<p>There seems to be no end to the complications and troubles
of this royal family. It is said that Wilhelmina, to soothe her
mother, treated her betrothed with great coldness; that her
younger sister Charlotte fell deeply in love with the Prince of
Baireuth, and endeavored to win him to herself; and that the
prince himself, attracted by warmth on the one hand, and repelled
by coldness on the other, was quite disposed to make the
exchange.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> The king, irritated by these interminable annoyances,
and the victim of chronic petulance and ill nature, recommenced
his brutal treatment of his daughter.</p>

<p>While these scenes were transpiring, the Crown Prince was at
Cüstrin, upon probation, being not yet admitted to the presence
of his father. He seems to have exerted himself to the utmost
to please the king, applying himself diligently to become familiar
with all the tedious routine and details of the administration of
finance, police, and the public domains. Fritz was naturally
very amiable. He was consequently popular in the little town
in which he resided, all being ready to do every thing in their
power to serve him. The income still allowed him by his father
was so small that he would have suffered from poverty had not
the gentry in the neighborhood, regardless of the prohibition to
lend money to the prince, contributed secretly to replenish his
purse.</p>

<p>A year and a day had elapsed since the father had seen the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
son. On the 15th of August, the king, being on a journey, stopped
for a couple of hours at Cüstrin, and held an interview with
Fritz. The monarch was attended by a retinue of several hundred
persons. The scene which ensued is described by Grumkow
in his summary of what took place at Cüstrin on the 15th
of August, 1731. The king sent for the prince to be brought
before him at the government house. As Fritz entered he fell
upon his knees at his father’s feet. The king coldly ordered
him to rise, saying,</p>

<p>“You will now recall to mind what passed a year and a day
ago—how scandalously you behaved, and what a godless enterprise
you undertook. As I have had you about me from the
beginning, and must know you well, I did all in the world that
was in my power, by kindness and by harshness, to make an
honorable man of you. As I rather suspected your evil purposes,
I treated you in the harshest and sharpest way in the Saxon
camp, in hopes you would consider yourself, and take another
line of conduct; would confess your faults to me, and beg forgiveness.
But all in vain. You grew ever more stiff-necked.
You thought to carry it through with your headstrong humor.
But hark ye, my lad! if thou wert sixty or seventy instead of
eighteen, thou couldst not cross my resolutions. And as up to
this date I have managed to sustain myself against any comer,
there will be methods found to bring thee to reason too.</p>

<p>“Have I not, on all occasions, meant honorably by you? Last
time I got wind of your debts, did I not, as a father, admonish
you to tell me all? I would pay all; you were only to tell me
the truth; whereupon you said there were still two thousand
thalers beyond the sum named. I paid these also at once, and
fancied I had made peace with you. And then it was found,
by-and-by, you owed many thousands more. And as you knew
you could not pay, it was as good as if the money had been
stolen—not to reckon how the French vermin, Montholieu and
partner, cheated you with their new loans.</p>

<p>“Nothing touched me so much as that you had not any trust
in me. All this that I was doing for the aggrandizement of the
house, the army, and the finances, could only be for you, if you
made yourself worthy of it. I here declare that I have done all
things to gain your friendship, and all has been in vain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
The Crown Prince, either deeply touched with penitence or
affecting to be so, again threw himself upon his knees before his
father, as if imploring pardon. The king continued:</p>

<p>“Was it not your intention to go to England?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the prince replied.</p>

<p>“Then hear what the consequences would have been. Your
mother would have got into the greatest misery. I could not
but have suspected she was the author of the business. Your
sister I would have cast for life into a place where she would
never have seen sun or moon again. Then on with my army to
Hanover, and burn and ravage—yes, if it had cost me life, land,
and people. Your thoughtless and godless conduct, see what it
was leading to. I intended to employ you in all manner of
business, civil and military. But how, after such action, could I
show your face to my officers?”</p>

<p>Here the young prince made the most solemn promises to try
to regain his father’s favor. The king then asked: “Was it
thou that temptedst Katte, or did Katte tempt thee?” Fritz
promptly replied, “I tempted Katte.” “I am glad,” rejoined
the king, “to hear the truth from you, at any rate.”</p>

<p>The king then rattled on without waiting for replies: “How
do you like your Cüstrin life? Do you still have as much aversion
to Wusterhausen, and to wearing your shroud, as you called
your uniform? Likely enough my company does not suit you.
I have no French manners, and can not bring out witty sayings
in the coxcomb way; and I truly consider all that as a thing to
be thrown to the dogs. I am a German prince, and mean to live
and die in that character. But you can now say what you have
got by your caprices and obstinate heart, hating every thing
that I liked, and if I distinguished any one, despising him. If
an officer was put in arrest, you took to lamenting about him.
Your real friends, who intended your good, you hated and calumniated.
Those who flattered you and encouraged your bad
purpose you caressed. You see what that has come to. In Berlin,
in all Prussia, for some time back, nobody asks after you,
whether you are in the world or not. And were it not that one
or the other coming from Cüstrin reports you as playing tennis
or wearing French hair-bags, nobody would know whether you
were dead, or alive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
Grumkow then goes on to relate, quite in detail, that the king
took up the subject of theology. “He set forth the horrible results
of that <em>absolute decree</em> notion which makes God the author
of sin; and that Jesus Christ died only for some.” The prince
declared that he had thoroughly renounced that heresy. The
king then added:</p>

<p>“When godless fellows about you speak against your duties
to God, the king, and your country, fall instantly on your knees
and pray with your whole soul to Jesus Christ to deliver you
from such wickedness, and lead you on better ways. And if it
come in earnest from your heart, Jesus, who would have all men
saved, will not leave you unheard.”</p>

<p>The Crown Prince, with what degree of sincerity we know
not, was now in tears. Prostrating himself before his majesty,
he kissed his feet. The king, much moved, was in tears also,
and retired to another room.</p>

<p>“It being his majesty’s birthday,” writes Grumkow, “the
prince, in deep emotion, followed his father, and, again falling
prostrate, testified such heartfelt joy, gratitude, and affection
over this blessed anniversary as quite touched the heart of the
king, who at last clasped him in his arms, and hurried out to
avoid sobbing aloud. The Crown Prince followed his majesty,
and, in the presence of many hundred people, kissed his majesty’s
feet, and was again embraced by his majesty, who said, ‘Behave
well, as I see you mean, and I will take care of you.’ Which
words,” writes Grumkow, “threw the Crown Prince into such
an ecstasy of joy as no pen can express.”</p>

<p>Two events occurred at this time highly characteristic of the
king. There was a nobleman by the name of Schlubhut, occupying
a high official position, who was found a defaulter to the
amount of a sum equal to twenty-five thousand dollars. The
supreme court sentenced him to three or four years’ imprisonment.
The king was indignant at the mildness of the sentence.
“What,” said he, “when the private thief is sent to the gallows,
shall a nobleman and a magistrate escape with fine and imprisonment?”
Schlubhut was immediately sent to prison. All
night long he was disturbed with the noise of carpentering in
the castle square in front of his cell. In the morning he saw directly
before his window a huge gallows erected. Upon that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
gallows he was immediately hung, and his body was left to
swing in the wind for several days, some say for weeks.</p>

    <div class="caption">DISCIPLINING THE JUDGES.</div></div>

<p>Soon after, a soldier, six feet three inches tall, the ringleader
of a gang, broke into a house and robbed it of property to the
amount of about five thousand dollars. He was sentenced to
be hung. We give the result in the words of Carlyle:</p>

<p>“Friedrich Wilhelm feels this sad contrast very much; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
more, as the soldier is his own chattel withal, and of superlative
inches. Friedrich Wilhelm flames up into wrath; sends off swift
messengers to bring these judges, one and all, instantly into his
presence. The judges are still in their dressing-gowns, shaving,
breakfasting. They make what haste they can. So soon as the
first three or four are reported to be in the anteroom, Friedrich
Wilhelm, in extreme impatience, has them called in; starts discoursing
with them upon the two weights and two measures.
Apologies, subterfuges, do but provoke him farther. It is not
long till he starts up growling terribly, ‘Ye scoundrels, how
could you?’ and smites down upon the crown of them with the
royal cudgel itself. Fancy the hurry-scurry, the unforensic attitudes
and pleadings! Royal cudgel rains blows right and left.
Blood is drawn, crowns cracked, crowns nearly broken; and several
judges lost a few teeth and had their noses battered before
they could get out. The second relay, meeting them in this dilapidated
state on the staircases, dashed home again without the
honor of a royal interview. This is an actual scene, of date, Berlin,
1731, of which no constitutional country can hope to see the
fellow. Schlubhut he hanged, Schlubhut being only Schlubhut’s
chattel. This musketeer, his majesty’s own chattel, he did not
hang, but set him shouldering arms again after some preliminary
dusting.”</p>

<p>The king, after his apparent reconciliation with Fritz, granted
him a little more liberty. He was appointed to travel over and
carefully inspect several of the crown domains. He was ordered
to study thoroughly the practical husbandry of those domains—how
they were to be plowed, enriched, and sown. He was also
to devote his attention to the rearing of cattle; to the preparing
of malt and the brewing of ale. “Useful discourse,” said the
king, “is to be kept up with him on these journeys, pointing out
why this is and that, and whether it could not be better.” On
the 22d of September the Crown Prince wrote to his father as
follows:</p>

<p>“I have been to Lebus. There is excellent land there; fine
weather for the husbandmen. Major Röder passed this way,
and dined with me last Wednesday. He has got a fine fellow
for my most all-gracious father’s regiment. I depend on my
most all-gracious father’s grace that he will be good to me. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
ask for nothing, and for no happiness in the world but what
comes from him; and hope that he will some day remember me
in grace, and give me the blue coat to put on again.”</p>

<p>It is very evident, from the glimpses we catch of Fritz at this
time, that he was a wild fellow, quite frivolous, and with but a
feeble sense of moral obligation. General Schulenburg, an old
soldier, of stern principles, visited him at Cüstrin, and sent an account
of the interview to Baron Grumkow, under date of October
4th, 1731. From this letter we cull the following statement:</p>

<p>“I found him much grown; an air of health and gayety about
him. He caressed me greatly. We went to dinner. He asked
me to sit beside him. Among other things, he said that he liked
the great world, and was charmed to observe the ridiculous, weak
side of some people.”</p>

<p>The prince inquired, in quite an indifferent tone, respecting
the marriages his father had in contemplation for him. He objected
to the marriage with the Princess of Mecklenburg, niece
of the Czar Peter, that it would require him to change his religion,
which he would not do. He expressed himself as inclined
to take the second daughter of the Emperor of Germany, if the
emperor would throw in a duchy or two.</p>

<p>“Since you speak so much of marriages,” said the general, “I
suppose you wish to be married?”</p>

<p>“No,” the prince replied; “but if the king absolutely will
have it, I will marry to obey him. After that I will shove my
wife into a corner, and live after my own fancy.”</p>

<p>Against this unprincipled declaration General Schulenburg
remonstrated, declaring it to be unchristian and dishonorable.
But the prince seemed to regard such suggestions very contemptuously.
“I can perceive,” the general adds, “that if he marries,
it will only be that he may have more liberty than now.
It is certain that if he had his elbows free he would strike out.
He said to me several times, ‘I am young; I want to profit by
my youth.’”</p>

<p>A fortnight later General Schulenburg wrote, under date of
the 19th of October: “I introduced to the Crown Prince all the
officers of my regiment who are here. He received them in the
style of a king. It is certain he feels what he is born to; and if
he ever get to it, he will stand on the top of it. As to me, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
mean to keep myself retired, and shall see as little of him as I
can. I perceive well he does not like advice, and does not take
pleasure except with men inferior to him in mind. His first aim
is to find out the ridiculous side of every one, and he loves to
banter and quiz.</p>

<p>“I assure you he is a prince who has talent, but who will be
the slave of his passions, and will like nobody but such as encourage
him therein. For me, I think all princes are cast in the
same mould. There is only a more and a less.”</p>

    <div class="caption">BERLIN PALACE.</div></div>

<p>On Tuesday, the 20th of November, 1731, Wilhelmina, eight
months after her betrothal, was married to the Prince of Baireuth.
The marriage ceremony was attended with great magnificence
in the royal palace of Berlin. The father of Frederick
William, who was fond of pageantry, had reared one of the most
sumptuous mansions in Europe, and had furnished it with splendor
which no other court could outvie. Entering the interior
of the palace through the outer saloon, one passed through nine
apartments <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en suite</i>, of grand dimensions, magnificently decorated,
the last of which opened into the picture-gallery, a room
ninety feet in length, and of corresponding breadth. All these
were in a line. Then turning, you entered a series of fourteen
rooms, each more splendid than the preceding. The chandeliers
were of massive solid silver. The ceilings were exquisitely painted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
by Correggio. Between each pair of windows there were mirrors
twelve feet high, and of such width that before each mirror
tables could be spread for twelve guests. The last of these magnificent
apartments, called the Grand Saloon, was illuminated by
“a lustre weighing fifty thousand crowns; the globe of it big
enough to hold a child of eight years, and the branches of solid
silver.”</p>

<p>Though Frederick the First had reared and originally furnished
this Berlin palace, yet the masses of solid silver wrought
into its ornamentation were mainly the work of Frederick William.
Conscious that his influence in Europe depended not only
upon the power of his army, but also upon the fullness of his
treasury, he had been striving, through all his reign, to accumulate
coin. But the money, barreled up and stored away in the
vaults of his palace, was of no service while thus lying idle.
Banking institutions seem not then to have been in vogue in his
realms. But the silver, wrought into chandeliers, mirror-frames,
and music balconies, added to the imposing splendor of his court,
gave him the reputation of great wealth, and could, at any time
when necessary, be melted down and coined. The wealth thus
hoarded by the father afterward saved the son from ruin, when
involved in wars which exhausted his treasury.</p>

<p>The queen remained bitterly unreconciled to the marriage of
Wilhelmina with any one but the Prince of Wales. Stung by
the sense of defeat, she did every thing in her power, by all sorts
of intrigues, to break off the engagement with the Prince of Baireuth.
When she found her efforts entirely unavailing, she even
went so far as to take her daughter aside and entreat her, since
the ceremony must take place, to refuse, after the marriage, to receive
the Prince of Baireuth as her husband, that the queen
might endeavor to obtain a divorce.</p>

<p>The annoyances to which Wilhelmina was exposed, while thus
preparing for her wedding, must have been almost unendurable.
Not only her mother was thus persistent and implacable in her
hostility, but her father reluctantly submitted to the connection.
He had fully made up his mind, with all the strength of his inflexible
will, that Wilhelmina should marry either the Margrave
of Schwedt or the Duke of Weissenfels. It was with extreme
reluctance, and greatly to his chagrin, that the stern old man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
found himself constrained, perhaps for the first time in his life,
to yield to others.</p>

<p>Even Wilhelmina had accepted the Prince of Baireuth, whom
she had never seen, only to avoid being sacrificed to men whom
she utterly loathed. Fortunately for the princess, her affections
were not otherwise engaged, and when introduced to her intended
she became quite reconciled to the idea of accepting him as
her husband.</p>

<p>On the day of the marriage, the princess, having formally renounced
all her rights to the personal property of the family,
dined with the royal household and her intended, and then retired
to her apartment to dress for the wedding. It would seem
that the queen must have become quite insane upon this point.
Even at this late hour she did every thing she could to delay
operations and to gain time, hoping every moment that some
courier would arrive from England with proposals which would
induce the king to break off the engagement. As fast as the
princess’s hair on one side was dressed the queen would contrive
to undo it, so that at last the hair would no longer curl, making
her look, as Wilhelmina said, “like a mad woman.” She adds:</p>

<p>“A royal crown was placed upon my head, together with twenty-four
curls of false hair, each as big as my arm. I could not
hold up my head, as it was too weak for so great a weight. My
gown was a very rich silver brocade, trimmed with gold lace, and
my train was twelve yards long. I thought I should have died
under this dress.”</p>

<p>The marriage took place in the Grand Saloon. The moment
the benediction was pronounced, a triple discharge of cannon announced
the event to the inhabitants of Berlin. Then the newly-married
pair, seated under a gorgeous canopy, received the
congratulations of the court. A ball followed, succeeded by a
supper. After supper there came, according to the old German
custom, what was called the <em>dance of torches</em>. This consisted of
the whole company marching to music in procession through the
rooms, each holding a lighted torch. The marriage festivities
were continued for several days, with a succession of balls each
night. Wilhelmina had not yet been permitted to see her brother
since his arrest. But the king had promised Wilhelmina, as
her reward for giving up the wretched Prince of Wales, that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
would recall her brother and restore him to favor. On Friday
evening, the 23d, three days after the wedding, there was a brilliant
ball in the Grand Apartment. Wilhelmina thus describes
the event which then took place:</p>

<p>“I liked dancing, and was taking advantage of my chances.
Grumkow came up to me, in the middle of a minuet, and said,
‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon dieu, madame</i>, you seem to have got bit by the tarantula.
Don’t you see those strangers who have just come in?’ I stopped
short, and, looking all around, I noticed at last a young man,
dressed in gray, whom I did not know. ‘Go, then,’ said Grumkow,
‘and embrace the Crown Prince. There he is before you.’
My whole frame was agitated with joy. ‘Oh, heavens, my brother!’
cried I; ‘but I do not see him. Where is he? For God’s
sake show him to me.’</p>

<p>“Grumkow led me to the young man in gray. Coming near,
I recognized him, though with difficulty. He had grown much
stouter, and his neck was much shorter. His face also was much
changed, and was no longer as handsome as it had been. I fell
upon his neck. I was so overcome that I could only speak in
an unconnected manner. I wept, I laughed like a person out of
her senses. In my life I have never felt so lively a joy. After
these first emotions were subsided I went and threw myself at
the feet of the king, who said to me aloud, in the presence of my
brother,</p>

<p>“‘Are you content with me? You see that I have kept my
word with you.’</p>

<p>“I took my brother by the hand, and implored the king to restore
his affection to him. This scene was so touching that it
drew tears from all present. I then approached the queen. She
was obliged to embrace me, the king being close opposite. But
I remarked that her joy was only affected. I turned to my brother
again. I gave him a thousand caresses, to all which he remained
cold as ice, and answered only in monosyllables. I presented
to him my husband, to whom he did not say one word.
I was astonished at this; but I laid the blame of it on the king,
who was observing us, and who I judged might be intimidating
my brother. But even the countenance of my brother surprised
me. He wore a proud air, and seemed to look down upon every
body.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

    <div class="caption">THE RECONCILIATION.</div></div>

<p>Neither the king nor the Crown Prince appeared at the supper.
With a select circle, to which neither Wilhelmina nor her
mother were admitted, they supped in a private apartment. At
the report that the king was treating the Crown Prince with
great friendliness, the queen could not conceal her secret pique.
“In fact,” says Wilhelmina, “she did not love her children except
as they served her ambitious views.” She was jealous of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
Wilhelmina because she, and not her mother, had been the means
of the release of Fritz. After supper the dancing was resumed,
and Wilhelmina embraced an opportunity to ask her brother
why he was so changed, and why he treated her so coldly. He
assured her that he was not changed; that his reserve was external
only; that he had reasons for his conduct. Still he did
not explain his reasons, and Wilhelmina remained wounded and
bewildered.</p>

<p>Before the king released the Crown Prince he extorted from
him an oath that he would be, in all respects, obedient to his father;
that he would never again attempt to escape, or take any
journey without permission; that he would scrupulously discharge
all the duties of religion, and that he would marry any
princess whom his father might select for him. The next morning,
after the interview to which we have above alluded, the
prince called upon his sister. They had a short private interview,
Madam Sonsfeld alone being present. The prince gave a
recital of his adventures and misfortunes during the many months
since they last had met. The princess gave an account of her
great trials, and how she had consented to a marriage, which
was not one of her choice, to obtain her brother’s release.</p>

<p>“He appeared,” she writes, “quite discountenanced at this last
part of my narrative. He returned thanks for the obligations I
have laid on him, with some caressings which evidently did not
proceed from the heart. To break this conversation he started
some indifferent topic, and, under pretense of seeing my apartment,
moved into the next room, where the prince, my husband,
was. Him he surveyed with his eyes from head to foot for some
time; then, after some constrained civilities to him, he went his
way.”</p>

<p>Wilhelmina and her husband soon left for Baireuth. Though
the princess thus left the splendors of a royal palace for the far
more quiet and humble state of a ducal mansion, still she was
glad to escape from a home where she had experienced so many
sorrows.</p>

<p>“Berlin,” she writes, “had become as odious to me as it once
was dear. I flattered myself that, renouncing grandeurs, I might
lead a soft and tranquil life in my new home, and begin a happier
year than the one which had just ended.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
As the king was about to take leave of his child, whom he
had treated so cruelly, he was very much overcome by emotion.
It is a solemn hour, in any family, when a daughter leaves the
parental roof, never to return again but as a visitor. Whether
the extraordinary development of feeling which the stern old
monarch manifested on the occasion was the result of nervous
sensibility, excited by strong drink or by parental affection, it is
not easy to decide. Wilhelmina, in a few words of intense emotion,
bade her father farewell.</p>

<p>“My discourse,” she writes, “produced its effect. He melted
into tears, and could not answer me for sobs. He explained his
thoughts by his embracings of me. Making an effort at length,
he said, ‘I am in despair that I did not know thee. They had
told me such horrible tales—I hated thee as much as I now love
thee. If I had addressed myself direct to thee I should have escaped
much trouble, and thou too. But they hindered me from
speaking. They said that thou wert ill-natured as the devil, and
wouldst drive to extremities, which I wanted to avoid. Thy
mother, by her intriguings, is in part the cause of the misfortunes
of the family. I have been deceived and duped on every side.
But my hands are tied. Though my heart is torn in pieces, I
must leave these iniquities unpunished.’”</p>

<p>“The queen’s intentions were always good,” Wilhelmina kindly
urged. The king replied, “Let us not enter into that detail.
What is past is past. I will try to forget it. You are the dearest
to me of all the family. I am too sad of heart to take leave
of you. Embrace your husband on my part. I am so overcome
that I must not see him.”</p>

<p>Wilhelmina, with flooded eyes, entered her carriage, bidding
a final adieu to the home of her childhood, where she had passed
through so many scenes, eventful and afflictive. Though she afterward
visited Berlin, it was her home no more. The Crown
Prince returned to Cüstrin, where he impatiently awaited his future
destinies.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">Upon</span> the return of the Crown Prince to Cüstrin after the
marriage of Wilhelmina, several of the officers of the army sent
in a petition to the king that he would restore to the prince his
uniform and his military rank. The king consented, and made
out his commission anew as colonel commandant of the Goltz
regiment at Ruppin. This was a small town about seventy-five
miles northeast of Berlin. His commission was signed on the
29th of February, 1732, he being then twenty years of age. In
this little hamlet, mainly engaged in the dull routine of garrison
duties, the prince passed most of his time for the next eight
years.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince was quite exasperated that the English
court would not listen to his earnest plea for the marriage of
Wilhelmina to the Prince of Wales, and accept his vows of fidelity
to the Princess Amelia. The stubborn adhesion of the King
of England to the declaration of “both marriages or none” so
annoyed him that he banished Amelia from his thoughts. In
his reckless way he affirmed that the romance of marriage was
all over with him; that he cared not much what bride was
forced upon him, provided only that she were rich, and that she
were not too scrupulous in religious principle. The tongues of
all the court gossips were busy upon this theme. Innumerable
were the candidates suggested to share the crown of the future
Prussian king. The Archduchess Maria Theresa, subsequently
the renowned Empress of Germany, was proposed by Prince
Eugene. But the imperial court could not wed its Catholic
heiress to a Protestant prince. Still the emperor, though unwilling
to give his daughter to the Crown Prince, was anxious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
for as close an alliance as possible with Prussia, and recommended
a niece of the empress, the young Princess Elizabeth Christina,
only daughter of Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick Bevern.
She was seventeen years of age, rather pretty, with a fine complexion,
not rich, of religious tastes, and remarkably quiet and
domestic in her character.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince did not fancy this connection at all. His
first wish was to journey about, through the courts of Europe,
to select him a wife. But that measure his father would not
think of. Frederick professed a willingness to submit to marry
Anna, Princess of Mecklenburg, or the Princess of Eisenach.
Seckendorf, the embassador of the emperor, aided by Grumkow,
who had been bribed, urged the marriage with Elizabeth. The
king adopted their views. His decision was like a decree of
fate. The following letter, written by the king to his son, dated
Potsdam, February 4, 1732, very clearly expresses his views:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Son Fritz</span>,—I am glad you need no more medicine.
But you must have a care of yourself some days yet, for the severe
weather gives me and every body colds. So pray be on
your guard.</p>

<p>“You know, my dear son, that when my children are obedient
I love them much. So when you were at Berlin, I from my
heart forgave you every thing; and from that Berlin time, since
I saw you, have thought of nothing but of your well-being, and
how to establish you; not in the army only, but also with a
right step-daughter, and so see you married in my lifetime. You
may be well persuaded I have had the Princesses of Germany
taken survey of, so far as possible, and examined by trusty people
what their conduct is, their education, and so on. And so a
princess has been found, the eldest one of Bevern, who is well
brought up, modest and retiring as a woman ought to be.</p>

<p>“You will quickly write me your mind on this. I have purchased
the Von Katsch house. The field marshal, as governor
of Berlin, will get that to live in. His government house I will
have made new for you, and furnish it all, and give you enough
to keep house yourself there.</p>

<p>“The princess is not ugly nor beautiful. You must mention
it to no mortal. Write indeed to mamma that I have written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
to you. And when you shall have a son, I will let you go on
your travels; wedding, however, can not be before next winter.
Meanwhile I will try and contrive opportunity that you see one
another a few times, in all honor, yet so that you get acquainted
with her. She is a God-fearing creature, will suit herself to you,
as she does to the parents-in-law.</p>

<p>“God give his blessing to it, and bless you and your posterity,
and keep you as a good Christian. And have God always before
your eyes, and don’t believe that damnable <em>predestination</em>
tenet; and be obedient and faithful. So shall it here in time,
and there in eternity, go well with thee. And whosoever wishes
that from the heart, let him say Amen.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“Your true father to the death,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Friedrich Wilhelm</span>.
</p>

<p>“When the Duke of Lorraine comes I will have thee come.
I think the bride will be here then. Adieu; God be with you.”</p></blockquote>

<p>One week after the reception of this letter the Crown Prince
wrote to Baron Grumkow in the following flippant and revolting
strain. He probably little imagined that the letter was to
be read by all Europe and all America. But those whose paths
through life lead over the eminences of rank and power can not
conceal their words or deeds from the scrutiny of the world.
Grumkow, a very shrewd man, had contrived to secure influence
over both the father and the son. The prince’s letter was dated
Cüstrin, February 11, 1732:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear General and Friend</span>,—I was charmed to learn,
by your letter, that my affairs are on so good a footing. You
may depend on it I am prepared to follow your advice. I will
lend myself to whatever is possible for me. And, provided I
can secure the king’s favor by my obedience, I will do all that
is within my power.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, in making my bargain with the Duke of Bevern,
manage that my intended be brought up under her grandmother.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
I should rather have a wife who would dishonor me
than to marry a blockhead who would drive me mad by her
awkwardness, and whom I should be ashamed to produce.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
“I beg you labor at this affair. When one hates romantic
heroines as heartily as I do, one dreads those timid virtues; and
I had rather marry the greatest profligate<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> in Berlin than a devotee
with half a dozen bigots at her beck. If it were still possible
to make her a Calvinist! But I doubt that. I will insist,
however, that her grandmother have the training of her. What
you can do to help me in this, my dear friend, I am persuaded
you will do.</p>

<p>“It afflicted me a little that the king still has doubts of me,
while I am obeying in such a matter diametrically opposite to
my own ideas. In what way shall I offer stronger proofs? I
may give myself to the devil, it will be to no purpose. Nothing
but the old song over again, doubt on doubt. Don’t imagine
I am going to disoblige the duke, the duchess, or the daughter,
I beseech you. I know too well what is due to them, and too
much respect their merits, not to observe the strictest rules of
what is proper, even if I hated their progeny and them like the
pestilence.</p>

<p>“I hope to speak to you with open heart at Berlin. You may
think, too, how I shall be embarrassed in having to act the lover
without being it, and to feign a passion for mute ugliness; for
I have not much faith in Count Seckendorf’s taste in this article.
Monsieur, once more get this princess to learn by heart the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ecole
des Maris</i> and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ecole des Femmes</i>. That will do her much
more good than <em>True Christianity</em> by the late Arndt. If, beside,
she would learn steadiness of humor, learn music, become
rather too free than too virtuous—ah! then, my dear general,
then I should feel some liking for her; and a Colin marrying a
Phillis, the couple would be in accordance. But if she is stupid,
naturally I renounce the devil and her.</p>

<p>“It is said she has a sister who at least has common sense.
Why take the eldest, if so? To the king it must be all one.
There is also a princess, Christina Marie, of Eisenach, who would
be quite my fit, and whom I should like to try for. In fine, I
mean soon to come into your countries, and perhaps will say,
like Cæsar, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Veni, vidi, vici</i>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In another letter to Grumkow, he writes: “As to what you
tell me of the Princess of Mecklenburg, could not I marry her?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
She would have a dowry of two or three million rubles.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> Only
fancy how I could live with that. I think that project might
succeed. I find none of these advantages in the Princess of Bevern,
who, as many people even of the duke’s court say, is not at
all beautiful, speaks almost nothing, and is given to pouting.
The good empress has so little money herself that the sums she
could afford her niece would be very moderate.”</p>

<p>Again, on the 19th of February, 1732, the Crown Prince wrote
from Cüstrin to Baron Grumkow. From his letter we make the
following extracts:</p>

<p>“Judge, my dear general, if I have been much charmed with
the description you give of the abominable object of my desires.
For the love of God disabuse the king in regard to her. Let
him remember that fools are commonly the most obstinate of
creatures. Let the king remember that it is not for himself that
he is marrying me, but for <em>my</em>self. Nay, he too will have a
thousand chagrins to see two persons hating one another, and
the most miserable marriage in the world; to hear their mutual
complaints, which will be to him so many reproaches for having
fashioned the instrument of our yoke. As a good Christian, let
him consider if it is well done to wish to force people, to cause
divorces, and to be the occasion of all the sins that an ill-assorted
marriage leads us to commit. I am determined to front every
thing in the world sooner. Since things are so, you may, in
some good way, apprise the Duke of Bevern that, happen what
may, I never will have her.</p>

<p>“I have been unhappy all my life, and I think it is my destiny
to continue so. One must be patient, and take the time as it
comes. Perhaps a sudden tract of good fortune, on the back of
all the chagrins I have encountered since I entered this world,
would have made me too proud. I have suffered sufficiently,
and I will not engage myself to extend my miseries into future
times. I have still resources. A pistol-shot can deliver me from
my sorrows and my life, and I think a merciful God would not
damn me for that, but, taking pity on me, would, in exchange
for a life of wretchedness, grant me salvation. This is whitherward
despair can lead a young person whose blood is not so
quiescent as if he were seventy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
“I have received a letter from the king, all agog about the
princess. When his first fire of approbation is spent, you might,
praising her all the while, lead him to notice her faults. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon
Dieu</i>, has he not already seen what an ill-assorted marriage comes
to—my sister of Anspach and her husband, who hate one another
like the fire? He has a thousand vexations from it every day.</p>

<p>“And what aim has the king? If it is to assure himself of
me, that is not the way. Madam of Eisenach might do it, but a
fool not. On the contrary, it is morally impossible to love the
cause of our misery. The king is reasonable, and I am persuaded
he will understand this himself.”</p>

<p>To his sister, Fritz wrote, about the same time, in a more subdued
strain, referring simply to his recent life in Cüstrin: “Thus
far my lot has been a tolerably happy one. I have lived quietly
in the garrison. My flute, my books, and a few affectionate
friends have made my way of life there sufficiently agreeable.
They now want to force me to abandon all this in order to marry
me to the Princess of Bevern, whom I do not know. Must
one always be tyrannized over without any hope of a change?
Still, if my dear sister were only here, I should endure all with
patience.”</p>

<p>Queen Sophie, who still clung pertinaciously to the idea of
the English match, was, of course, bitterly hostile to the nuptial
alliance with Elizabeth. Indeed, the queen still adhered to the
idea of the double English marriage, and exhausted all the arts
of diplomacy and intrigue in the endeavor to secure the Princess
Amelia for the Crown Prince, and to unite the Prince of Wales
to a younger sister of Wilhelmina. Very naturally she cherished
feelings of strong antipathy toward Elizabeth, who seemed
to be the cause, though the innocent cause, of the frustration of
her plans. She consequently spoke of the princess in the most
contemptuous manner, and did every thing in her power to induce
her son to regard her with repugnance. But nothing could
change the inexorable will of the king. Early in March the
doomed Princess Elizabeth, a beautiful, artless child of seventeen
years, who had seen but little of society, and was frightened in
view of the scenes before her, was brought to Berlin to be betrothed
to the Crown Prince, whom she had never seen, of whom
she could not have heard any very favorable reports, and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
whom she had never received one word of tenderness. The
wreck of happiness of this young princess, which was borne so
meekly and uncomplainingly, is one of the saddest which history
records. Just before her arrival, Fritz wrote to his sister as follows.
The letter was dated Berlin, March 6, 1732:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest Sister</span>,—Next Monday comes my betrothal,
which will be done just as yours was. The person in question
is neither beautiful nor ugly; not wanting in sense, but very ill
brought up, timid, and totally behind in fashionable address.
That is the candid portrait of the princess. You may judge by
that, my dearest sister, if I find her to my taste or not.</p>

<p>“You never can believe, my adorable sister, how concerned I
am about your happiness. All my wishes centre there, and every
moment of my life I form such wishes. You may see by this
that I preserve still that sincere friendship which has united our
hearts from our tenderest years. Recognize at least, my dear
sister, that you did me a sensible wrong when you suspected me
of fickleness toward you, and believed false reports of my listening
to tale-bearers—me, who love only you, and whom neither
absence nor lying rumors could change in respect of you. At
least, don’t again believe such things on my score, and never mistrust
me till you have had clear proof, or till God has forsaken
me, or I have lost my wits.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“Your most humble brother and servant,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Frederick</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>The betrothal took place in the Berlin palace on Monday
evening, March 10, 1732. Many distinguished guests from foreign
courts were present. The palace was brilliantly illuminated.
The Duke and Duchess of Bevern, with their son, had accompanied
their daughter Elizabeth to Berlin. The youthful
pair, who were now to be betrothed only, not married, stood in
the centre of the grand saloon, surrounded by the brilliant assemblage.
With punctilious observance of court etiquette, they exchanged
rings, and plighted their mutual faith. The old king
embraced the bride tenderly. The queen-mother, hoping that
the marriage would never take place, saluted her with repulsive
coldness. And, worst of all, the prince himself scarcely treated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
her with civility. The sufferings of this lovely princess must
have been terrible. The testimony to her beauty, her virtues,
her amiable character, is uncontradicted. The following well-merited
tribute to her worth is from the pen of Lord Dover:</p>

<div id="ip_143" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.625em;">
  <img src="images/i_143.jpg" width="458" height="595" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">THE BETROTHAL.</div></div>

<p>“Elizabeth Christina, who became the wife of Frederick the
Great, was a princess adorned with all the virtues which most
dignify human nature; religious, benevolent, charitable, affectionate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
of the strictest and most irreproachable conduct herself,
yet indulgent and forgiving for the faults of others. Her whole
life was passed in fulfilling the circle of her duties, and, above
all, in striving without ceasing to act in the way she thought
would be most pleasing to her husband, whom she respected, admired,
and even loved, in spite of his constant neglect of her.”</p>

<p>Baron Bielfeld, a member of the court, thus describes her personal
appearance: “Her royal highness is tall of stature, and
her figure is perfect. Never have I seen a more regular shape
in all its proportions. Her neck, her hands, and her feet might
serve as models to the painter. Her hair, which I have particularly
admired, is of a most beautiful flaxen, but somewhat inclining
to white, and shines, when not powdered, like rows of pearls.
Her complexion is remarkably fine; and in her large blue eyes
vivacity and sweetness are so happily blended as to make them
perfectly animated.</p>

<p>“The princess has an open countenance; her eyebrows are
neat and regular; her nose is small and angular, but very elegantly
defined; and her coral lips and well-turned neck are
equally admirable. Goodness is strongly marked in her countenance;
and we may say, from her whole figure, that the Graces
have exerted themselves in forming a great princess. Her highness
talks but little, especially at table, but all she says is sterling
sense. She appears to have an uncommon genius, which
she ornaments by the continual study of the best French authors.”</p>

<p>The reception of the princess was so cruel, by Queen Sophie
and her younger daughter Charlotte, that the inexperienced
maiden of but seventeen summers must have been perfectly
wretched. But she could only bear her anguish in silence.
There was nothing for her to say, and nothing for her to do. She
was led, by resistless powers, a victim to the sacrifice.</p>

<p>About three weeks after this sad betrothal, Fritz wrote to his
sister Wilhelmina, under date of Berlin, March 24, 1732, as follows:</p>

<p>“God be praised, my dearest sister, that you are better. Nobody
can love you more tenderly than I do. As to the Princess
of Bevern, the queen bids me answer that you need not style her
‘Highness,’ but that you may write to her quite as to an indifferent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
princess. As to ‘kissing the hands,’ I assure you I have
not kissed them nor will kiss them. They are not pretty enough
to tempt me that way.</p>

<p>“Believe, my charming sister, that never brother in the world
loved with such tenderness a sister so charming as mine.”</p>

<p>The betrothed princess, bewildered, wounded, heart-broken,
returned with her parents to her home, there to await the consummation
of her sacrifice by being married to a man who had
never addressed to her a loving word, and who, in his heart, had
resolved never to receive her as his wife. The Crown Prince, unfeeling
and reckless, returned to his dissolute life in garrison at
Ruppin. The queen continued an active correspondence with
England, still hoping to break the engagement of her son with
Elizabeth, and to secure for him the Princess Amelia.</p>

<p>Ruppin, where the Crown Prince continued to reside for several
years, was a small, dull town of about two thousand inhabitants.
The only life it exhibited was found in the music and
drillings of the garrison. The only important event in its history
was the removal of the Crown Prince there. Of what is
called society there was none. The hamlet was situated in the
midst of a flat, marshy country, most of it quite uncultivated.
The region abounded in peat bogs, and dark, still lakes, well
stocked with fish.</p>

<p>A comfortable house, with garden and summer-house, was provided
for the Crown Prince. He occasionally gave a dinner-party
to his brother officers; and from the summer-house rockets
were thrown into the sky, to the great gratification of the
rustic peasantry.</p>

<p>Both father and son had become by this time fully satisfied
that their tastes and characters were so different that it was not
best for them to live near each other. The prince spent much
of his time with his flute. He also engaged in quite a wide
range of reading to occupy the listless hours. Works of the
most elevated and instructive character especially interested him,
such as history, biography, moral and intellectual philosophy,
and polite literature in its higher branches of poetry and the
drama. “What mankind have done and been in this world,”
writes Carlyle, “and what the wisest men, poetical or other, have
thought about mankind and their world, this is what he evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
had the appetite for—appetite insatiable, which lasted
him to the very end of his days.”</p>

<p>It is unquestionable that the mental discipline acquired by
this elevated course, to which he consecrated so diligently his
hours, prepared him for the wonderful career upon which he
soon entered, and enabled him to act with efficiency which filled
Europe with his renown.</p>

<p>It appears, moreover, that Fritz devoted himself very assiduously
to his military duties, earnestly studying the art of war,
and making himself familiar with the achievements of the most
renowned commanders. His frugal father allowed him but a
very meagre income for a prince—not above four thousand five
hundred dollars a year. With this sum it was scarcely possible
to keep up even the appearance of such an establishment as belonged
to his rank. Such glimpses as we get of his moral and
social developments during this period are not favorable. He
paid no respect to the claims of religion, and was prone to revile
Christianity and its advocates. He was particularly annoyed
if the chaplain uttered, in his sermons, any sentiments which the
prince thought had a bearing against the sensual indulgences
and the wild amusements of himself and his companions. On
one occasion the chaplain said in his sermon, “There was Herod,
who had Herodias to dance before him, and he gave her
John the Baptist’s head for her pains.”</p>

<p>The prince assumed to make a personal application of this.
Herod meant the Crown Prince; Herodias, his boon companions;
and John the Baptist was the chaplain. To punish the offender,
the prince, with several brother officers, went at night, smashed
the windows of the chaplain, and threw in a shower of fire-crackers
upon him and his wife, who was in delicate health, driving
them in dismay out into the stable-yard. The stern old king
was very indignant at this conduct. Grumkow affirms, we hope
falsely, that the prince threw the whole charge upon his associate
officers, and that they were punished for the deed, while he
escaped.</p>

<p>Thus the summer of 1732 passed away. In November Wilhelmina
returned from Baireuth to Berlin on a visit. She remained
at home for ten months, leaving her babe, Frederica, at
Baireuth. There must have been some urgent reason to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
induced her to make this long visit, for her reception, by both
father and mother, was far from cordial. Neither of them had
been really in favor of the match with the young prospective
Margraf of Baireuth, but had yielded to it from the force of circumstances.
The journey to Berlin was long and cold. Her
mother greeted her child with the words, “What do you want
here? What is a mendicant like you come hither for?” The
next day her father, who had been upon a journey, came home.
His daughter had been absent for two years. And yet this
strange father addressed her in the following cruel and sarcastic
words:</p>

<p>“Ah! here you are. I am glad to see you.” Then, taking a
light, he carefully examined her from head to foot. After a moment’s
silence, he added, “How changed you are! I am sorry
for you, on my word. You have not bread to eat, and but for
me you might go a-begging. I am a poor man myself; not able
to give you much; will do what I can. I will give you now
and then twenty or thirty shillings, as my affairs permit. It will
always be something to assuage your want. And you, madam,”
turning to the queen, “will sometimes give her an old dress, for
the poor child hasn’t a shift to her back.”</p>

<p>This merciless banter from her parents cut the unhappy princess
to the heart. With the utmost difficulty she refrained from
bursting into convulsive crying. Her husband seems to have
been a kind man, inspired with true and tender affection for his
wife. But much of the time he was necessarily absent on regimental
duty. The old Marquis of Baireuth, her husband’s father,
was penurious, irascible, and an inebriate. Wilhelmina often
suffered for the necessaries of life. There seemed to be no refuge
for her. The home of her step-parents was unendurable, and
the home of her childhood was still more so. Few and far between
must have been the joys which visited her crushed heart.</p>

<p>A few days after her arrival at Berlin, Fritz, on short leave of
absence, ran over from Ruppin, and had a brief interview with
his sister, whom he had not seen since her marriage. The royal
family supped together, with the exception of the king, who was
absent. At the table the conversation turned upon the future
princess royal, Elizabeth. The queen said, addressing Wilhelmina,
and fixing her eyes on Fritz,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
“Your brother is in despair at the idea of marrying her. And
he is not wrong. She is an actual fool. She can only answer
whatever is said to her by <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em>, accompanied by a silly
laugh, which is painful to hear.”</p>

<p>Charlotte added, in terms still more bitter and unpardonable,
“Your majesty is not yet aware of all her merit. I was one
morning at her toilet. I remarked that she is deformed. Her
gown is stuffed on one side, and she has one hip higher than the
other.” The cruel girl even went so far as to accuse the princess
of suffering from loathsome ulcers. This discourse was uttered
in a loud voice, in presence of the domestics. Fritz was
evidently greatly annoyed, and blushed deeply, but said nothing.
Immediately after supper he retired. Wilhelmina soon followed
him, and they met again privately in Wilhelmina’s room.
The princess asked her brother how he was now getting along
with his father. He replied,</p>

<p>“My situation changes every moment. Sometimes I am in favor,
sometimes in disgrace. My chief happiness consists in my
being absent from him. I lead a quiet and tranquil life with
my regiment at Ruppin. Study and music are my principal occupations.
I have built me a house there, and laid out a garden
where I can read and walk about.”</p>

<p>“Then,” writes Wilhelmina, “as to his bride, I begged him to
tell me candidly if the portrait the queen and my sister had been
making of her were the true one.”</p>

<p>“We are alone,” Fritz replied, “and I will conceal nothing from
you. The queen, by her miserable intrigues, has been the source
of our misfortunes. Scarcely were you gone when she began
again with England. She wished to substitute our sister Charlotte
for you, and to contrive her marriage with the Prince of
Wales.</p>

<p>“You may easily imagine that she used every endeavor for
the success of her plan, and also to marry me to the English
Princess Amelia. The king was informed of this design from
its commencement. He was much nettled at these fresh intrigues,
which have caused many quarrels between the queen
and him. Seckendorf finally took part in the affair, and counseled
the king to make an end of all these plans by concluding
my marriage with the Princess of Bevern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
“The queen can not console herself for this reverse. She vents
her despair in the abuse of that poor princess. She wanted me
to refuse the marriage decidedly, and told me that she should
not mind my quarreling again with the king provided I would
only show firmness, in which case she would be well able to
support me. I would not follow her advice, and declared to her
plainly that I did not choose to incur the displeasure of my father,
which had already caused me so much suffering.</p>

<p>“With regard to the princess herself, I do not dislike her as
much as I pretend. I affect not to be able to bear her, in order
to make the more merit of my obedience to the king. She is
pretty—a complexion of lily and rose. Her features are delicate,
and her whole face is that of a beautiful person. She has
no breeding, and dresses ill. But I flatter myself that when she
comes here you will have the goodness to assist in forming her.
I recommend her to you, my dear sister; and I hope you will
take her under your protection.”</p>

<p>On Monday, the 8th of June, 1733, the Crown Prince left Ruppin,
and, joining his father and mother, set out, with a suitable
retinue, for the ducal palace of Salzdahlum, in Brunswick, where
the marriage ceremony was to be solemnized. Fritz was twenty-one
years of age. Elizabeth was not quite eighteen. The
wedding took place at noon of Friday, the 12th, in the beautiful
chapel of the palace, with the usual display of splendor and rejoicing.
The mansion, situated a few miles from Wolfenbüttel,
was renowned for its gardens and picture-galleries, and was considered
one of the finest in Europe.</p>

<p>The ceremony was performed by the Reverend Johann Lorenz
Mosheim, favorably known throughout Christendom for his treatise
upon Ecclesiastical History. Immediately after the nuptial
benediction had been pronounced, Fritz wrote as follows to Wilhelmina:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
“Salzdahlum, Noon, June 12, 1733.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sister</span>,—A minute since the whole ceremony was
finished. God be praised, it is over. I hope you will take it as
a mark of my friendship that I give you the first news of it. I
hope that I shall have the honor to see you again soon, and to
assure you, my dear sister, that I am wholly yours. I write in
great haste, and add nothing that is merely formal. Adieu.</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">Frederick.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
The queen behaved very unamiably, “plunged in black melancholy,”
and treating her new daughter-in-law with great contempt.
There have been many sad weddings, but this was surely
one of the saddest. Frederick had often declared that he never
would receive the princess as his wife. In the evening, just after
the newly-married couple had retired to their room, through the
arrangement of the prince, a false alarm of fire was raised by
some of his friends. This furnished him with the opportunity
to rush from the apartment. He did not return. Ever after
he saw the princess but unfrequently, treating her with cold politeness
when they met, though on public occasions giving her,
with all external forms of civility, the position of honor to which,
as his wedded wife, she was entitled.</p>

<p>It was apparently easy for the Crown Prince to relinquish
Amelia. But the English princess, being very unhappy at home,
had fixed her affections upon Frederick with the most romantic
tenderness. In beauty of person, in chivalric reputation, in exalted
rank, he was every thing an imaginative maiden could have
desired. She regarded him probably as, in heart, true to her.
He had often sent his protestations to the English court that he
would never marry any one but Amelia. Though the marriage
ceremony had been performed with Elizabeth, he recognized only
its legal tie. Poor Amelia was heart-crushed. Earth had no longer
any joys for her. She never married, but wore the miniature
of the prince upon her breast for the rest of her days. We have
no record of the weary years during which grief was consuming
her life. Her eyelids became permanently swollen with weeping.
And when, at the age of sixty, she died, the miniature of
the Crown Prince was still found resting upon her true and faithful
heart. Amelia and Elizabeth—how sad their fate! Through
no fault of their own, earth was to them both truly a vale of
tears. The only relief from the contemplation of the terrible
tragedies of earth is found in the hope that the sufferers may
find compensation in a heavenly home.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 16th, the King and Queen of Prussia left
Salzdahlum to return to Potsdam. At the close of the week
the Crown Prince and his bride, escorted by a brilliant retinue
of Brunswick notabilities, set out on their return. In most of
the intervening towns they were received with great pomp. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
the 27th, the last day of the next week, the bridal pair had a
grand entrance into Berlin. The troops were all out upon parade.
The clang of bells, the roar of cannon, and peals of martial
music filled the air. All the inhabitants of Berlin and the
surrounding region were in the streets, which were spanned by
triumphal arches, and garlanded with flowers. Gladly would
the princess have exchanged all this for one loving word from
her husband. But that word was not uttered. Two days before
the grand reception at Berlin the princess arrived at Potsdam.
Here Wilhelmina, for the first time, met her cruelly-wronged
and heart-crushed sister-in-law. In the following terms
she describes the interview:</p>

<p>“The king led the princess into the queen’s apartment. Then
seeing, after she had saluted us all, that she was much heated
and her hair deranged, he bade my brother take her to her own
room. I followed them thither. My brother said to her, introducing
me,</p>

<p>“‘This is a sister I adore, and to whom I am obliged beyond
measure. She has the goodness to promise me that she will
take care of you and help you with her good counsel. I wish
you to respect her beyond even the king and queen, and not to
take the least step without her advice. Do you understand?’</p>

<p>“I embraced the Princess Royal,” Wilhelmina continues, “and
gave her every assurance of my attachment. But she remained
like a statue, not answering a word. Her people not being come,
I arranged her hair and readjusted her dress a little, without the
least sign of thanks or any answer to all my caressings. My
brother got impatient at last, and said aloud,</p>

<p>“‘Devil’s in the blockhead! Thank my sister, then?’</p>

<p>“She made me a courtesy on the model of that of Agnes in
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ecole des Femmes</i>. I took her back to the queen’s apartment,
little edified by such a display of talent.”</p>

<p>It is probable that the princess, in the strangeness of her position,
very young and inexperienced, and insulted by cruel neglect,
in the freshness of her great grief dared not attempt to utter
a syllable, lest her voice should break in uncontrollable sobbings.
The Crown Prince returned to Ruppin, leaving the princess
at Berlin. Charles, the heir-apparent to the ducal crown
of Brunswick, and brother of the Princess Elizabeth, about a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
week after the arrival of the princess in Berlin, was married to
Fritz’s sister Charlotte—that same wicked Charlotte who had
flirted with Wilhelmina’s intended, and who had so shamelessly
slandered the betrothed of her brother. Several fêtes followed
these marriages, with the usual concomitants of enjoyment and
disappointment. Wilhelmina thus describes one of them:</p>

<p>“The next day there was a great promenade. We were all
in phaetons, dressed out in our best. All the nobility followed
in carriages, of which there were eighty-five. The king, in a Berline,
led the procession. He had beforehand ordered the round
we were to take, and very soon fell asleep. There came on a
tremendous storm of wind and rain, in spite of which we continued
our procession at a foot’s pace. It may easily be imagined
what state we were in. We were as wet as if we had been in
the river. Our hair hung about our ears, and our gowns and
head-dresses were destroyed. We got out at last, after three
hours’ rain, at Monbijou, where there was to be a great illumination
and ball. I never saw any thing so comical as all these ladies,
looking like so many Xantippes, with their dresses sticking
to their persons. We could not even dry ourselves, and were
obliged to remain all the evening in our wet clothes.”</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">About</span> six miles from Ruppin there was the village of Reinsberg,
containing about one thousand inhabitants, clustered around
an ancient dilapidated castle. Frederick was with his regiment
in Ruppin. The Princess Royal, his wife, resided in Berlin.
There was an ostensible reason for this separation in the fact
that there was no suitable mansion for the royal couple at Ruppin.
The castle, with its extensive grounds, belonged to a French
refugee. The king purchased it, and assigned it to his son. As
the whole estate was in a condition of extreme dilapidation,
Frederick immediately commenced improvements and repairs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
The building, the gardens, the forests, and the surrounding lands
rapidly assumed a new aspect, until Reinsberg became one of
the most attractive spots in Europe.</p>

<p>The situation of the castle was admirable. A beautiful sheet
of water bathed its walls on one side, while a dense forest of
oaks and beeches rose like an amphitheatre upon the other.
The whole edifice assumed the form of a square, with two towers
connected by a double colonnade, richly ornamented with
vases and statuary. Over the majestic portal was inscribed the
motto, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Frederico, tranquillitatem colenti</i>.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> The interior of the
palace, in the magnitude and arrangement of the apartments,
their decoration and furniture, was still more imposing than the
exterior. The grand saloon was a superb hall, the walls lined
with mirrors and costly marbles, and the ceiling painted by the
most accomplished artists of the day. The garden, with its avenues,
and bowers, and labyrinth of bloom, extended the whole
length of the lake, upon whose waters two beautiful barges floated,
ever ready, under the impulse of sails or oars, to convey parties
on excursions of pleasure.</p>

<p>This immense building presented a front of nearly a thousand
feet; for, being in a quadrangular form, it fronted four ways. It
was all faced with hammered stone. In one of the towers this
bachelor husband constructed his library. It was a magnificent
apartment, provided with every convenience, and decorated with
the most tasteful adornments which the arts could furnish. Its
windows commanded an enchanting prospect of the lake, with
its tufted islands and the densely wooded heights beyond.</p>

<p>The apartments prepared for the Princess Royal were also very
magnificent. Her parlor was twenty feet high. It had six windows,
three opening in the main front toward the town, and the
other three opening toward the interior court. The spaces between
the windows were covered with immense mirrors, so arranged
as to display the ceiling, beautifully painted by one of
the finest artists of the day. The artist had spread his colors
with such delicacy and skill, so exquisitely blending light and
shade, that the illusion was almost perfect. The spectator felt
that the real sky, with its fleecy clouds and infinite depth of
blue, overarched him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
Three years were occupied in enlarging and decorating this
palace. In the mean time the Princess Elizabeth resided in Berlin,
or in a small country house provided for her at Schönhausen.
The Crown Prince occasionally visited her, always treating her
with the marked respect due a lady occupying her high position.</p>

<p>The king was by no means pleased with the costly luxuries
with which his son was surrounding himself. But he had, in a
very considerable degree, lost his control over the Crown Prince.
Frederick was now twenty-one years of age. He had married
the niece of the Emperor of Germany. The emperor had probably
once saved his life, and was disposed particularly to befriend
him, that he might secure his alliance when he should become
King of Prussia. Frederick was now the rising sun, and his father
the setting luminary. All the courts in Europe were interested
in winning the regards of the Crown Prince.</p>

<p>The king, as we have mentioned, allotted to his son a very
moderate income, barely enough for the necessary expenses of
his establishment. But the prince borrowed money in large
sums from the Empress of Germany, from Russia, from England.
It was well known that, should his life be preserved, he would
soon have ample means to repay the loan. Frederick William
probably found it expedient to close his eyes against these transactions.
But he did not attempt to conceal the chagrin with
which he regarded the literary and voluptuous tastes of his son.</p>

<p>“When I am dead,” he said, petulantly, “you will see Berlin
full of madmen and freethinkers, and the sort of people who
walk about the streets.”</p>

<p>Wilhelmina’s purse was generally empty, and she was often in
great want of money. Her penurious father had married her
below her rank that he might escape settling upon her a dowry.
Though her husband was heir to the marquisate of Baireuth, his
father was still living. That father was a drunkard and a miser.
It seems that the son received but little more than his wages as
colonel in the army. Wilhelmina records that one day her
brother Fritz came to her and said,</p>

<p>“Seckendorf” (the embassador of the emperor) “sometimes
sends me money, of which I have great need. I have already
taken measures that he should procure some for you. My <em>galleons</em>
arrived yesterday, and I will divide their contents with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
He then gave her a thousand crowns. Wilhelmina manifested
a little natural reluctance in receiving the money. But he
shrugged his shoulders and said,</p>

<p>“Take them freely. The empress sends me as much money
as I wish. I assure you that by this means I get rid of the demon
of poverty as soon as I find him approaching me.”</p>

<p>“The empress, then,” added Wilhelmina, “is a better exorcist
than other priests.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the Crown Prince replied; “and I promise you that
she will drive away your demon as well as mine.”</p>

<p>Poland, ever in turmoil, was at this time choosing a king.
The emperor advocated the claims of August of Saxony. France
urged Stanislaus, a Polish noble, whose daughter had married
the French dauphin. War ensued between France and Germany.
Frederick William became the ally of the emperor. An
army of ten thousand men, admirably equipped and organized,
was upon the march for the Rhine, to act with the emperor
against France. The Crown Prince was very eager to join the
expedition, and obtained permission to do so.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 29th of June, 1734, there was a grand
ball at the little palace of Monbijou. At three o’clock in the
morning the Crown Prince changed his ball-dress for a military
suit, and with his staff set out at full speed for the seat of war.
They traveled in carriages, by post, night and day, hastening to
take part in the siege of Philipsburg. A little after midnight
on the morning of the 2d of July, they reached Hof, having traveled
two hundred miles, and having two hundred miles still farther
to go. At Hof the prince was within thirty-five miles of
Baireuth, to which place Wilhelmina had some time before returned.
He was very anxious to see her. But his father had
strictly prohibited his going through Baireuth, under the assumption
that it would occasion loss of time. Frederick made
arrangements with Wilhelmina, who was in a very delicate state
of health, to meet him at Berneck, about twelve miles from Baireuth.
But, unfortunately, one of the carriages which conveyed
the Crown Prince and his companions lost a wheel, which detained
them several hours. The commands of the king were explicit
that the Crown Prince should not be separated from the
rest of the company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
Thus Wilhelmina, upon reaching Berneck, according to appointment,
did not find her brother there, and could hear nothing
from him. The prince, upon his arrival at Hof, wrote as follows
to his sister</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
“Hof, July 2, 1734, not long after 4 A.M.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sister</span>,—Here I am, within six leagues of a sister
I love, and I have to decide that it will be impossible to see her
after all. I have never so lamented the misfortune of not depending
on myself as at this moment. The king being very sour
sweet on my score, I dare not risk the least thing. A week from
next Monday, when he arrives himself, I should be queerly treated
in the camp if I were found to have disobeyed orders.</p>

<p>“The queen commands me to give you a thousand regards
from her. She appeared much affected at your illness. But I
can not warrant you how sincere it was, for she is totally changed,
and I no longer comprehend her. She has done me all the hurt
with the king she could. As to Sophie, she is no longer the
same. She approves all the king says or does, and is charmed
with her big clown of a bridegroom.</p>

<p>“The king is more difficult than ever. He is content with
nothing. He has no gratitude for whatever favors one can do
him. As to his health, it is one day better, another worse; but
the legs they are always swelled. Judge what my joy must be
to get out of that turpitude; for the king will only stay a fortnight
at most in camp.</p>

<p>“Adieu! my adorable sister. I am so tired I can not stir,
having left on Tuesday night, or rather Wednesday morning, at
three o’clock, from a ball at Monbijou, and arrived here this Friday
morning at four. I recommend myself to your gracious remembrance,
and am, for my own part, till death, dearest sister,
your</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Frederick</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the mean time, Wilhelmina, disappointed in not finding her
brother, wrote to him the following account of her adventures:</p>

<p>“I got to Berneck at ten. The heat was excessive. I found
myself quite worn out with the little journey I had taken. I
alighted at the house which had been got ready for my brother.
We waited for him, and in vain waited till three in the afternoon.
At three we lost patience; had dinner served without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
him. While we were at table there came on a frightful thunder-storm.
I have witnessed nothing so terrible. The thunder
roared and reverberated among the rocky cliffs which begirdle
Berneck, and it seemed as if the world were going to perish. A
deluge of rain succeeded the thunder.</p>

<p>“It was four o’clock, and I could not understand what had
become of my brother. I had sent out several persons on horseback
to get tidings of him, and none of them came back. At
length, in spite of all my prayers, the hereditary prince<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> himself
would go in search. I was in cruel agitations. These cataracts
of rain are very dangerous in the mountain countries. The roads
get suddenly overflowed, and accidents often happen. I thought
for certain one had happened to my brother, or to the hereditary
prince.</p>

<p>“At last, about nine, somebody brought word that my brother
had changed his route and gone to Culmbach, there to stay
overnight. I was for setting out thither. Culmbach is twenty
miles from Berneck. But the roads are frightful, and full of
precipices. Every body rose in opposition. And whether I
would or not they put me into the carriage for Himmelkron,
which is only about ten miles off. We had like to have got
drowned on the road, the waters were so swollen. The horses
could not cross but by swimming.</p>

<p>“I arrived at last about one in the morning. I instantly threw
myself on a bed. I was like to die of weariness, and in mortal
terror that something had happened to my brother or the hereditary
prince. The latter relieved me on his own score. He arrived
at last about four o’clock; had still no news of my brother.
I was beginning to doze a little, when they came to inform
me that M. von Knobelsdorf wished to speak to me from the
Prince Royal. I darted out of bed and ran to him.”</p>

<p>Knobelsdorf was the bearer of a second letter from the Crown
Prince. The first had not reached her. Frederick, having taken
an hour or two of sleep at Hof, rose much refreshed, and, continuing
his journey about fifteen miles farther, wrote this second
letter as follows to his sister:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
“Munchberg, July 2, 1734.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Sister</span>,—I am in despair that I can not satisfy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
my impatience and my duty, to throw myself at your feet this
day. But, alas! dear sister, it does not depend upon me. We
poor princes are obliged to wait here till our generals come up.
We dare not go along without them. They broke a wheel in
Gera. Hearing nothing of them since, we are absolutely forced
to wait here. Judge in what a mood I am, and what sorrow
must be mine. Express order not to go by Baireuth or Anspach.
Forbear, dear sister, to torment me on things not depending on
myself at all.</p>

<p>“I waver between hope and fear of paying my court to you.
I hope it might still be at Berneck, if you could contrive a road
into the Nürnberg highway again, avoiding Baireuth; otherwise
I dare not go. The bearer, Captain Knobelsdorf, will apprise
you of every particular. Let him settle something that
may be possible. This is how I stand at present: instead of
having to expect some favor from the king, I get nothing but
chagrin. But what is more cruel upon me than all is that you
are ill. God, in his grace, be pleased to help you, and restore
that health which I so much wish for you.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Frederick.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Arrangements were made for them to meet at eight o’clock
Saturday morning, at the Lake House, situated on a small island
in a beautiful artificial sheet of water a couple of miles north of
Baireuth. The prince thus obeyed the letter of the order not
to go to Baireuth. The following account of the interview which
ensued is from the pen of Wilhelmina:</p>

<p>“My brother overwhelmed me with caresses, but found me
in so pitiable a state that he could not restrain his tears. I was
not able to stand on my limbs, and felt like to faint every moment,
so weak was I. He told me that the king was very angry
at the margraf for not letting his son make the campaign. I
told him all the margraf’s reasons, and added surely they were
good, in respect of my dear husband.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said he, ‘let him quit soldiering then, and give back
his regiment to the king. But quiet yourself as to the fears you
may have about him if he do; for I know, by certain information,
that there will be no blood spilt.’</p>

<p>“The hereditary prince came in while we were talking, and
earnestly entreated my brother to get him away from Baireuth.
They went to a window and talked a long time together. My
brother told me he would write a letter to the margraf, and give
him such reasons in favor of the campaign that he doubted not
it would turn the scale. He promised to obtain the king’s express
leave to stop at Baireuth on his return, after which he went
away. It was the last time I saw him on the old footing with
me. He has much changed since then. We returned to Baireuth,
where I was so ill that for three days they did not think
I should get over it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
After this interview the Crown Prince hurried away on his
route to Philipsburg. He reached Nürnberg that night, where
he wrote the following brief but affectionate letter to his sister:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
“Nürnberg, July 3, 1734.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My very dear Sister</span>,—It would be impossible to leave
this place without signifying, dearest sister, my lively gratitude
for all the marks of favor you showed me in the House on the
Lake. The highest of all that it was possible to do was that
of procuring me the satisfaction of paying my court to you. I
beg millions of pardons for so incommoding you, dearest sister,
but I could not help it, for you know my sad circumstances well
enough. I entreat you write me often about your health. Adieu,
my incomparable and dear sister. I am always the same to you,
and will remain so till my death.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Frederick.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Early on the morning of the 4th the prince left Nürnberg, and
reached the camp at Weisenthal on the 7th. Here the imperial
and Prussian troops were collected, who had been sent to attempt
to raise the siege of Philipsburg. But the French lines investing
the city were so strong that Prince Eugene, in command of
the imperial army, did not venture to make an attack. The
Crown Prince almost immediately rode out to reconnoitre the
lines of the foe. As he was returning through a strip of forest
a cannonade was opened, and the balls went crashing around
him through the trees. Pride of character probably came to the
aid of constitutional courage. The prince did not in the slightest
degree quicken his pace. Not the least tremor could be perceived
in his hand as he held the reins. He continued conversing
with the surrounding generals in perfect tranquillity, as if
unconscious of any danger.</p>

<p>A week after the arrival of the prince the Prussian king entered
the camp. As it was expected that some remarkable feats
of war would be exhibited in the presence of the king, under the
leadership of the renowned Prince Eugene, a very large assemblage
of princes and other distinguished personages was collected
on the field. The king remained for a month, dwelling in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
tent among his own troops, and sharing all their hardships. He,
with his son, attended all the councils of war. Still no attempt
was made to relieve Philipsburg. The third day after the king’s
arrival the city surrendered to the French. The campaign continued
for some time, with unavailing manœuvring on both sides
of the Rhine; but the Crown Prince saw but little active service.
About the middle of August the king left the camp to return
home. His health was seriously impaired, and alarming
symptoms indicated that he had not long to live. His journey
was slow and painful. Gout tortured him. Dropsy threatened
to strangle him. He did not reach home until the middle of
September. The alarming state of the king’s health added very
much to the importance of the Crown Prince. It was evident
that ere long he must come into power. The following characteristic
anecdote is related of the king during this illness:</p>

<p>One evening, being too unwell to read his usual devotions, he
called upon his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">valet de chambre</i> to read prayers. In the prayer
occurred the words, “May God bless thee.” The servant, not
deeming it respectful to use <em>thee</em> in reference to the king, took
the liberty to change the phrase, and read it, “May God bless
<em>you</em>.” The king, exasperated, hurled something at the head of
the speaker, exclaiming, “It is not so; read it again.” The terrified
servant, not conceiving in what he had done wrong, read
again, “May God bless you.” The irascible monarch, having
nothing else he could grasp, took off his night-cap and threw it
into the man’s face, exclaiming, “It is not so; read it over again.”
The servant, frightened almost out of his senses, read for the
third time, “May God bless you.” “<em>Thee</em>, rogue,” shouted the
king. “‘May God bless <em>thee</em>.’ Dost thou not know, rascal, that,
in the eyes of God, I am only a miserable rascal like thyself?”</p>

<p>Early in October, the Crown Prince, not socially or morally
improved by his campaigning, set out on his return to Berlin.
He was by no means insensible to the fact that the crown of
Prussia would soon rest upon his brow. On the 5th he called
again upon his sister at Baireuth. She was sick and very sad.
The following is Wilhelmina’s account of the interview:</p>

<p>“My brother arrived on the 5th of October. He seemed to
me in ill humor. To break off conversation with me, he said that
he had to write to the king and queen. I ordered him pen and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
paper. He wrote in my room, and spent more than a good hour
in writing a couple of letters of a line or two each. He then
had all the court, one after another, introduced to him; said
nothing to any of them; looked merely with a mocking air at
them; after which we went to dinner.</p>

<div id="ip_162" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.9375em;">
  <img src="images/i_162.jpg" width="463" height="464" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">THE KING AND HIS SERVANT.</div></div>

<p>“Here his whole conversation consisted in quizzing whatever
he saw, and repeating to me, above a hundred times over, the
words ‘little prince,’ ‘little court.’ I was shocked, and could not
understand how he had changed so suddenly toward me. The
etiquette of all courts in the empire is, that nobody who has not
at least the rank of captain can sit at a prince’s table. My
brother put a lieutenant there who was in his suite, saying, ‘A
king’s lieutenant is as good as a margraf’s minister.’ I swallowed
this incivility, and showed no sign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
“After dinner, being alone with me, he said, ‘Our sire is approaching
his end. He will not live out this month. I know
that I have made you great promises, but I am not in the condition
to keep them. I will leave you the half of the sum which
my predecessor lent you. I think that you will have every reason
to be satisfied with that.’</p>

<p>“I answered that my regard for him had never been of an interested
nature; that I would never ask any thing of him but
the continuance of his friendship; and that I did not wish for
one penny if it would in the least inconvenience him.</p>

<p>“‘No, no,’ said he; ‘you shall have those one hundred thousand
thalers. I have destined them for you. People will be
much surprised to see me act quite differently from what they
had expected. They imagine I am going to lavish all my treasures,
and that money will become as common as pebbles in
Berlin. But they will find that I know better. I mean to increase
my army, and to leave all other things on the old footing.
I will have every consideration for the queen, my mother, and
will satiate her with honors. But I do not mean that she shall
meddle with my affairs. If she try it she will find so.’</p>

<p>“I fell from the clouds on hearing all that, and knew not if I
were sleeping or waking. He then questioned me on the affairs
of this country. I gave him the detail of them. He said to me,
‘When your goose of a father-in-law dies, I advise you to break
up the whole court, and reduce yourselves to the footing of a
private gentleman’s establishment in order to pay your debts.
In real truth, you have no need of so many people. And you
must try to reduce the wages of those whom you can not help
keeping. You have been accustomed to live, at Berlin, with a
table of four dishes. That is all you want here. I will invite
you now and then to Berlin, which will spare table and house
expenses.’</p>

<p>“For a long time my heart had been swelling. I could not
restrain my tears at hearing all these indignities. ‘Why do you
cry?’ said he. ‘Ah! ah! I see that you are in low spirits. We
must dissipate that dark humor. The music waits us. I will
drive that fit out of you by an air or two on the flute.’ He
gave me his hand and led me into the other room. I sat down
to the harpsichord, which I inundated with my tears.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
On the fourth day after the arrival of the Crown Prince at
Baireuth, a courier came with a letter from the queen conjuring
him to return immediately, as the king was growing worse and
worse. Frederick immediately hastened to Potsdam, and on
the 12th of October entered the sick-chamber of his father in the
palace there. He seems to have thought nothing of his wife,
who was at Berlin. We have no evidence that he wrote to her
during his absence, or that he visited her upon his return. For
four months the king remained a great sufferer in Potsdam, trembling
between life and death. It was often with great difficulty
that he could breathe. He was impatient and irritable in the
extreme. As he was rolled about in his Bath chair, he would
petulantly cry out, “Air! air!” as if his attendants were to blame
for his shortness of breath. The distress from the dropsy was
very great. “If you roll the king a little fast,” writes an attendant,
“you hear the water jumble in his body.” The Crown
Prince was deeply affected in view of the deplorable condition
of his father, and wept convulsively. The stern old king was
stern to the end. He said one day to Frederick, “If you begin
at the wrong end with things, and all go topsy-turvy after I am
gone, I will laugh at you out of my grave.”</p>

<p>Quite unexpectedly, the latter part of January the virulence
of the king’s complicated diseases of gout, dropsy, and ulcers
seemed to abate. Though but forty-seven years of age, he was,
from his intemperate habits, an infirm old man. Though he lingered
along for many months, he was a great sufferer. His unamiability
filled the palace with discomfort.</p>

<p>Frederick returned to Ruppin. Though he treated his wife
with ordinary courtesy, as an honored member of the court, his
attentions were simply such as were due to every lady of the
royal household. It does not appear that she accompanied him
to Ruppin or to Reinsberg at that time, though the apartments
to which we have already alluded were subsequently provided
for her at Reinsberg, where she was ever treated with the most
punctilious politeness. Lord Dover says that after the accession
of the prince to the throne he went to see his wife but once a
year, on her birthday. She resided most of the time at Berlin,
surrounded by a quiet little court there. However keen may
have been her sufferings in view of this cruel neglect, we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
no record that any word of complaint was ever heard to escape
her lips. “This poor Crown Princess, afterward queen,” says
Carlyle, “has been heard, in her old age, reverting in a touching,
transient way to the glad days she had at Reinsberg. Complaint
openly was never heard of her in any kind of days; but
these, doubtless, were the best of her life.”</p>

<div id="ip_165" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.6875em;">
  <img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="459" height="462" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">FRITZ IN HIS LIBRARY.</div></div>

<p>Frederick had become very ambitious of high intellectual culture
and of literary renown. He gathered around him a numerous
class of scholarly men, and opened an extensive correspondence
with the most distinguished philosophers, poets, and historians
all over Europe. He commenced and persevered in a course
of very rigorous study, rising at an early hour, and devoting the
unbroken morning to intellectual pursuits. The renowned men
of earth have not attained their renown but by untiring exertions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
For six or seven consecutive hours every day the prince
was busy in his library, when no one was allowed to interrupt
him. He wrote to a friend about this time:</p>

<p>“Having been not quite well lately, my physician has advised
me to take more exercise than I have hitherto done. This has
obliged me to mount my horse and take a gallop every morning.
But, in order not to be obliged on that account to change my
ordinary way of life, I get up earlier, in order to regain on the
one hand what I lose on the other.”</p>

<p>He rose about five o’clock. After a horseback ride of an hour
he devoted the mornings to his books. The remainder of the
day was given to society, music, and recreation. The following
extract from his correspondence throws additional light upon
the employment of his time. The letter was addressed to an
intimate friend, Baron Von Suhm, of Saxony:</p>

<p>“I think you will not be sorry if I say a few words to you respecting
our rural amusements, for with persons who are dear
to us we love to enter even into the smallest details. We have
divided our occupations into two classes, of which the first consists
of what is useful, and the second of what is agreeable. I
reckon in the list of the usefuls the study of philosophy, history,
and languages. The agreeables are music, the tragedies and comedies
which we represent, the masquerades and presents which
we give. The serious occupations, however, have always the
prerogative of going before the others. And I think I can say
that we make a reasonable use of our pleasures, only indulging
in them to relieve the mind, and to prevent moroseness and too
much philosophic gravity, which is apt not to yield a smile even
to the graces.”</p>

<p>Again he wrote a few months after, while absent from home:
“I set off on the 25th to return to my dear garden at Ruppin.
I burn with impatience to see again my vineyards, my cherries,
and my melons. There, tranquil and free from all useless cares,
I shall live really for myself. I become every day more avaricious
of my time, of which I render an account to myself, and
never lose any of it without much regret. My mind is now
wholly turned toward philosophy. That study renders me wonderful
services, which are repaid by me with affection. I find
myself happy because I am more tranquil than formerly. My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
soul is much less agitated with violent and tumultuous emotions.
I suppress the first impulses of my passions, and do not
proceed to act upon them till after having well considered the
question before me.”</p>

<p>Immediately after his return he wrote again: “I am now a
peaceable inhabitant of Reinsberg, applying myself to study and
reading almost from morning till night. With regard to the news
of this world, you will learn them better through the gazetteers
than through me. They contain the history of the madness and
folly of the great, the wars of some, the quarrels of others, and
the childish amusements of all. These news are as little worthy
the attention of a man of sense as the quarrels of rats and mice
would be.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>The king was not at all pleased either with his son’s studies
or his recreations. Philosophy and literature were as obnoxious
to the sturdy old monarch as were music and all amusements
save the rough pastime of hunting stags and boars. He was a
thorough materialist, having no other thought than to drill his
troops and develop the resources of his realm. Beer and tobacco,
both of which he used inordinately, were almost his only luxuries.
He often growled loudly at what he deemed the coxcombry
of his son and companions at Reinsberg, and frequently
threatened to disperse his associates.</p>

<p>But Frederick was now a full-grown man. His heirship to
the throne rendered him a power among the courts of Europe.
It was doubtful whether he would again submit to a caning.
The infirm old king, gouty, dropsical, weakened, and lamed by
ulcers, could not conceal from himself that his power, with his
energies, was rapidly waning. Indeed, at times, he even talked
of abdicating in favor of his son. Whenever there was a transient
abatement in his maladies, he roused himself to the utmost,
took short journeys, and tried to deceive himself into the belief
that he was well again.</p>

<p>The principal companions of Frederick at Reinsberg were gay,
pleasure-loving men. Among them were Major Keyserling, a
thoughtless young man, full of vivacity, and of very agreeable
manners; and M. Jordan, a French young gentleman, formerly a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
preacher, very amiable, and an author of considerable note. M.
Jordan was devotedly attached to the prince, and continued so
through life. He gives the following testimony to the good qualities
of Frederick:</p>

<p>“It is not the king that I love in him; it is the man. If I
considered the dignity and the power of the king, I should only
seek to keep myself at a distance from him. But the qualities
which are personal to him, both of the heart and of the head,
they attach me to him for life, without reserve and without
fear.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>Lieutenant Chasot, another of his friends, was a French officer
who had killed a brother officer in a duel at Philipsburg,
and, in consequence, had fled to the Prussian lines. He had
brightness of intellect and winning manners, which rendered
him a universal favorite. Captain Knobelsdorf was a distinguished
musician and architect. He rendered signal service in
enlarging and decorating the chateau at Reinsberg. Baron De
Suhm, with whom Frederick kept up a constant correspondence,
was then in Saxony, translating for the Crown Prince the philosophy
of Wolff. He sent the prince chapter by chapter, with copious
notes.</p>

<p>In this assembly of gay young men religion was generally a
topic of ridicule. Even Jordan, the ex-preacher, was either willingly
or unwillingly borne along by the current. Subsequently,
when youth and health had fled, and he was on a sick-bed
suffering from lingering disease, he felt the need of those consolations
which Christianity alone can give. He wrote, under date
of April, 1745, to Frederick, who was then king, and whose
friendship continued unabated:</p>

<p>“My complaint increases so much that I no longer even hope
to recover from it. I feel strongly, in the situation in which I
at present find myself, the necessity of an enlightened religion
arising from conviction. Without that, we are the beings on
earth most to be pitied. Your majesty will, after my death, do
me the justice to testify that if I have combated superstition
with vehemence, I have always supported the interests of the
Christian religion, though differing from the ideas of some theologians.
As it is only possible when in danger to discover the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
necessity of bravery, so no one can really have the consoling advantage
of religion except through sufferings.”</p>

<p>It speaks well for Frederick that during this illness, which
was long and painful, he almost daily visited at the bedside of
his friend, ministering to his wants with his own hand. After
his death the king continued his kindness to the bereaved family.
Baron Bielfeld gives the following account of one of the
scenes of carousal in which these men engaged, when in the enjoyment
of youth and health:</p>

<p>“About a fortnight ago the prince was in a humor of extraordinary
gayety at the table. His gayety animated all the rest;
and some glasses of Champagne still more enlivened our mirth.
The prince, perceiving our disposition, was willing to promote it,
and on rising from table, told us that he was determined that we
should recommence our jollity at supper.</p>

<p>“We were scarcely seated at supper before he began by drinking
a number of interesting healths, which there was a necessity
of pledging. This first skirmish being over, it was followed by
an incessant flow of sallies and repartees. The most contracted
countenances became expanded. The gayety was general, even
the ladies assisting in promoting our jollity.</p>

<p>“After about two hours I stepped out for a moment into the
vestibule. I had placed before me a large glass of water, which
the princess, opposite to whom I had the honor to sit, in a vein
of mischievous pleasantry, had ordered to be emptied, and had
filled it with Sellery wine, which was as clear as rock water.
Having already lost my taste, I mixed my wine with wine.
Thinking to refresh myself, I became joyous, but it was a kind
of joy that leaned toward intoxication.</p>

<p>“To finish my picture—the prince ordered me to come and sit
by him. He said many gracious things to me, and let me see
into futurity as far as my feeble sight was then capable of discovering.
At the same time, he made me drink bumper after
bumper of his Lunelle wine. The rest of the company, however,
were not less sensible than I of the effects of the nectar which
there flowed in such mighty streams.</p>

<p>“At last, whether by accident or design, the princess broke a
glass. This was the signal for our impetuous jollity, and an example
that appeared highly worthy of our imitation. In an instant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
all the glasses flew to the several corners of the room. All
the crystals, porcelain, mirrors, branches, bowls, and vases were
broken into a thousand pieces. In the midst of this universal
destruction, the prince stood, like the man in Horace who contemplates
the crush of worlds, with a look of perfect tranquillity.</p>

<div id="ip_170" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.9375em;">
  <img src="images/i_170.jpg" width="463" height="603" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">THE BANQUET.</div></div>

<p>“To this tumult succeeded a fresh burst of mirth, during which
the prince slipped away, and, aided by his pages, retired to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
apartment; and the princess immediately followed. The day
after this adventure the court was at its last gasp. Neither the
prince nor any of the courtiers could stir from their beds.”</p>

<p>Baron Bielfeld himself was so intoxicated that, in attempting
to retire, he fell down the grand staircase from top to bottom.
He was severely bruised, and was taken up senseless. “After
lying about a fortnight in bed,” he writes, “where the prince had
the goodness to come every day to see me, and to contribute
every thing possible to my cure, I got abroad again.”</p>

<p>Frederick William, through spies, kept himself informed of
every thing which was said or done at Reinsberg. Such orgies
as the above excited his contempt and abhorrence. But, notwithstanding
the above narrative, there is abundant testimony that
the prince was not ordinarily addicted to such shameful excesses.
The Italian Count Algarotti, distinguished alike for his familiarity
with the sciences and his cultivated taste for the fine arts,
was an honored guest at Reinsberg. In a letter addressed to
Lord Hervey, under date of September 30th, 1739, the count
writes:</p>

<p>“What shall I say to you, my lord, of the Prince Royal, the
lover and the favorite of the Muses? Several days, which we
passed with him in his castle of Reinsberg, seemed to be but a
few hours. He is the most intelligent and the most amiable of
men. Though I could notice only his private virtues, I can boldly
assure you, my lord, that the world will one day admire his
royal qualifications, and that when he shall be upon the throne
he will show himself to be the greatest of sovereigns. There is
all the reason in the world to believe that he will seek out for
great men with as much eagerness as his father does for giants.”</p>

<p>Baron Bielfeld gives the following account of the ordinary
employments, and the tone of conversation of the prince: “All
the employments and all the pleasures of the prince are those
of a man of understanding. He is, at this time, actually engaged
in refuting the dangerous political reveries of Machiavel. His
conversation at table is charming. He talks much and excellently
well. His mind seems to be equal to all sorts of subjects,
and his imagination produces on each of them a number of new
and just ideas. His genius resembles the fire of the vestals that
was never extinct. A decent and polite contradiction is not disagreeable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
to him. He possesses the rare talent of displaying
the wit of others, and of giving them opportunity to shine on
those subjects in which they excel. He jests frequently, and
sometimes rallies, but never with asperity; and an ingenious retort
does not displease him.</p>

<p>“Nothing can be more elegant than this prince’s library. It
has a view of the lake and gardens. A collection, not very numerous,
but well chosen, of the best books in the French language
are ranged in glass cases, which are ornamented with carvings
and gildings in excellent taste. The portrait of M. De Voltaire
occupies an honorable place in this library. He is the favorite
author of the prince, who has, in general, a high esteem for good
French writers both in prose and verse.</p>

<p>“The evenings are devoted to music. The prince has a concert
in his saloon, where no one enters who is not invited, and
such invitation is regarded as an extraordinary favor. The prince
has commonly performed a sonata and a concert for the flute, on
which he plays in the greatest perfection. He fills the flute admirably
well, has great agility with the fingers, and a vast fund
of music. He composes himself sonatas. I have had the honor
of standing behind him more than once while he was playing,
and was charmed with his taste, especially in the <em>adagio</em>. He
has a continual creation of new ideas.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DEATH OF FREDERICK WILLIAM.</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Voltaire and Madame Du Châtelet.—Letter from Frederick to Voltaire.—The Reply.—Visit
to the Prince of Orange.—Correspondence.—The Crown Prince becomes a Mason.—Interesting
Letter from the Crown Prince.—Petulance and declining Health of the King.—Scenes
in the Death-chamber.—Characteristic Anecdotes.—The Dying Scene.</p></blockquote>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">The</span> Crown Prince had for some time been inspired with an
ever-increasing ambition for high intellectual culture. Gradually
he was gathering around him, in his retreat at Reinsberg, men
of high literary reputation, and was opening correspondence with
the most distinguished men of letters in all the adjacent countries.</p>

<p>Voltaire was, at this time, about forty years of age. His renown
as a man of genius already filled Europe. He was residing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
on terms of the closest intimacy, with Madame Du Châtelet,
who had separated from her husband. With congenial tastes
and ample wealth they occupied the chateau of Cirey, delightfully
situated in a quiet valley in Champagne, and which they
had rendered, as Madame testifies, a perfect Eden on earth. It
is not always, in the divine government, that sentence against
an evil work is “executed speedily.” Madame Du Châtelet, renowned
in the writings of Voltaire as the “divine Emilie,” was
graceful, beautiful, fascinating. Her conversational powers were
remarkable, and she had written several treatises upon subjects
connected with the pure sciences, which had given her much deserved
celebrity.</p>

<p>Still it is evident that the serpent was in this Eden. Carlyle
writes: “An ardent, aerial, gracefully predominant, and, in the
end, somewhat termagant female, this divine Emilie. Her temper,
radiant rather than bland, was none of the patientest on occasion.
Nor was M. De Voltaire the least of a Job if you came
athwart him in a wrong way. I have heard that their domestic
symphony was liable to furious flaws; that plates, in presence
of the lackeys, actual crockery or metal, have been known to fly
from end to end of the dinner-table; nay, they mention ‘knives,’
though only in the way of oratorical action; and Voltaire has
been heard to exclaim, ‘Don’t fix those haggard, sidelong eyes
on me in that way!’—mere shrillness of pale rage presiding over
the scene.”</p>

<p>Voltaire had already written the epic poem the <cite>Henriade</cite>, the
history of <cite>Charles XII.</cite>, and several tragedies.</p>

<p>The first letter from Frederick to Voltaire was dated August
8th, 1736. The following extracts will show the spirit of this
flattering epistle:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>,—Although I have not the satisfaction of knowing
you personally, you are not the less known to me through
your works. They are treasures of the mind, if I may so express
myself; and they reveal to the reader new beauties at every perusal.
I think I have recognized in them the character of their
ingenious author, who does honor to our age and to human nature.
If ever the dispute on the comparative merits of the moderns
and the ancients should be revived, the modern great men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
will owe it to you, and to you only, that the scale is turned in
their favor. With the excellent quality of poet you join innumerable
others more or less related to it.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, there is nothing I wish so much as to possess all
your writings. Pray do communicate them to me without reserve.
If there be among your manuscripts any that you wish
to conceal from the eyes of the public, I engage to keep them in
profoundest secrecy.</p>

<p>“I should think myself richer in the possession of your works
than in that of all the transient goods of fortune.</p>

<p>“You inspire the ambition to follow in your footsteps. But
I, how often have I said to myself, unhappy man! throw down
a burden which is above thy strength! One can not imitate
Voltaire without being Voltaire.</p>

<p>“It is in such moments that I have felt how small are those
advantages of birth, those vapors of grandeur, with which vanity
would solace us. They amount to little, properly to nothing.
Ah! would glory but make use of me to crown your successes!</p>

<p>“If my destiny refuse me the happiness of being able to possess
you, may I at least hope one day to see the man whom I
have admired so long now from afar, and to assure you, by word
of mouth, that I am, with all the esteem and consideration due
those who, following the torch of truth for guide, consecrate their
labors to the public, Monsieur, your affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">Frederick</span>, <i>Prince Royal of Prussia</i>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Voltaire promptly replied to this letter in corresponding terms
of flattery. His letter was dated Cirey, August 26th, 1736:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,—A man must be void of all feeling who were
not infinitely moved by the letter which your royal highness has
deigned to honor me with. My self-love is only too much flattered
by it. But my love of mankind, which I have always
nourished in my heart, and which, I venture to say, forms the
basis of my character, has given me a very much purer pleasure
to see that there is now in the world a prince who thinks as a
man—a <em>Philosopher</em> prince, who will make men happy.</p>

<p>“Permit me to say there is not a man on the earth but owes
thanks for the care you take to cultivate, by sound philosophy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
a soul that is born for command. Good kings there never were
except those who had begun by seeking to instruct themselves;
by knowing good men from bad; by loving what was true; by
detesting persecution and superstition. No prince, persisting in
such thoughts, but might bring back the golden age into his
countries.</p>

<p>“Unless one day the tumult of business and the wickedness
of men alter so divine a character, you will be worshiped by
your people and loved by the whole world. Philosophers, worthy
of the name, will flock to your states. The illustrious Queen
Christina quitted her kingdom to go in search of the arts. Reign
you, Monseigneur, and the arts will come to seek you.</p>

<p>“I will obey your commands as to sending those unpublished
pieces. Your criticism will be my reward. It is a price few
sovereigns can pay. I am sure of your secrecy. Your virtue
and your intellect must be in proportion. I should indeed consider
it a precious happiness to come and pay my court to your
royal highness. One travels to Rome to see paintings and ruins.
A prince such as you is a much more singular object, worthier
of a long journey.</p>

<p>“In whatever corner of the world I may end my life, be assured,
Monseigneur, my wishes will be continually for you. My
heart will rank itself among your subjects. Your glory will be
ever dear to me. I shall wish, May you always be like yourself,
and may other kings be like you. I am, with profound respect,
your royal highness’s most humble</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Voltaire</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>The correspondence thus commenced was prosecuted with
great vigor. It seemed difficult to find language sufficiently expressive
of their mutual admiration. Frederick received many
of Voltaire’s unpublished manuscripts, and sent him many tokens
of regard. Some of Frederick’s manuscripts Voltaire also examined,
and returned with slight corrections and profuse expressions
of delight.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1738 the infirm old king undertook a journey
to Holland, on a visit of diplomacy to the Prince of Orange.
The Crown Prince accompanied him. It does not, however, appear
that they had much intercourse with each other on the
journey. They spent several days at the beautiful palace of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
Loo, in Geldern, occupied by the Prince of Orange and his English
bride, a niece to his Prussian majesty. The palace was
imposing in its architectural structure, containing many gorgeous
saloons, and surrounded with beautiful gardens. In a letter
which Frederick wrote from Loo to Voltaire, dated August 6th,
we find the following sentiments:</p>

<p>“I write from a place where there lived once a great man,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>
which is now the Prince of Orange’s house. The demon of ambition
sheds its unhappy poisons over his days. He might be
the most fortunate of men, and he is devoured by chagrins in his
beautiful palace here, in the middle of his gardens and of a brilliant
court.”</p>

<p>In one of the letters of the Crown Prince, speaking of the mode
of traveling with his father, he says: “We have now been traveling
near three weeks. The heat is as great as if we were riding
astride upon a ray of the sun. The dust is like a dense
cloud, which renders us invisible to the eyes of the by-standers.
In addition to this, we travel like the angels, without sleep, and
almost without food. Judge, then, what my condition must be.”</p>

<p>While on this journey to Holland the Crown Prince was one
day dining with a prince of Lippe-Bückeburg. Freemasonry
became one of the topics of conversation at the table. King
Frederick William denounced the institution in his usual style
of coarse vituperation, as tomfoolery, atheism, and every thing
else that was bad. But the Prince of Bückeburg, himself a mason
and a very gentlemanly man, defended the craft with such
persuasive eloquence as quite captivated the Crown Prince. After
dinner the prince took him secretly aside, conversed with him
more fully upon the subject, expressed his admiration of the system,
and his wish to be admitted into the fraternity: But it
was necessary carefully to conceal the step from the irate king.
Arrangements were immediately made to assemble at Brunswick
a sufficient number of masons from Hamburg, where the Crown
Prince, on his return, could be received in a secret meeting into
the mystic brotherhood.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince met the masons by agreement at “Korn’s
Hotel.” On the night of Tuesday, August 14th, 1738, the king
having that evening continued his journey, Frederick, after adopting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
extreme precautions to prevent any publicity of the act, fearing
probably only lest it should reach his father’s ears, passed
through the mysterious rites of initiation. It does not, however,
appear that subsequently he took any special interest in the society.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>The year 1739 was spent by the prince mostly at Reinsberg.
Many distinguished visitors were received at the chateau. Frederick
continued busily engaged in his studies, writing both prose
and verse, and keeping up a lively correspondence with Voltaire
and other literary friends. He engaged very earnestly in writing
a book entitled <cite>Anti-Machiavel</cite>, which consisted of a refutation
of Machiavel’s <cite>Prince</cite>. This book was published, praised,
and read, but has long since been forgotten. The only memorable
thing about the book now is that in those dark days of absolutism,
when it was the almost universally recognized opinion
that power did not ascend from the people to their sovereign,
but descended from the monarch to his subjects, Frederick should
have spoken of the king as the “born servant of his people.”</p>

<p>In July of this year the Crown Prince took another journey
with his father through extensive portions of the Prussian territory.
The following extract from one of his letters to Voltaire
reflects pleasing light upon the heart of Frederick, and upon the
administrative ability of his father:</p>

<p>“Prussian Lithuania is a hundred and twenty miles long, by
from forty to sixty broad. It was ravaged by pestilence at the
beginning of this century, and they say three hundred thousand
people died of disease and famine. The disorder carried off the
people, and the lands remained uncultivated and full of weeds.
The most flourishing of our provinces was changed into the most
miserable of solitudes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
“Meanwhile Frederick the First died, and with him was buried
all his false grandeur, which consisted only in a vain magnificence,
and in the pompous display of frivolous ceremonies. My
father, who succeeded him, compassionated the general misery.
He visited the spot, and saw, with his own eyes, this vast country
laid waste, and all the dreadful traces which a contagious
malady, a famine, and the sordid avarice of a venal administration
leave behind them. Twelve or fifteen towns depopulated,
and four or five hundred villages uninhabited, presented themselves
to his view. Far from being discouraged by such a sad
spectacle, his compassion only became the more lively from it;
and he resolved to restore population, plenty, and commerce to
this land, which had even lost the appearance of an inhabited
country.</p>

<p>“Since this time he has spared no expense for the furtherance
of his salutary intentions. He first established wise regulations
and laws. He rebuilt whatever had been allowed to go to ruin
in consequence of the plague. He brought and established there
thousands of families from the different countries of Europe.
The lands became again productive, and the country populous.
Commerce reflourished; and at the present time abundance
reigns in this country more than ever before. There are now
half a million of inhabitants in Lithuania. There are more towns
than formerly; more flocks, and more riches and fertility than
in any other part of Germany.</p>

<p>“And all that I have been relating to you is due to the king
alone, who not only gave the orders, but himself saw that they
were faithfully obeyed. He both conceived the designs and executed
them. He spared neither care, nor trouble, nor vast treasures,
nor promises, nor recompenses, in order to assure the existence
and the comfort of half a million of rational beings, who
owe to him alone their happiness. There is something in my
mind so heroic in the generous and laborious manner in which
the king has devoted himself to the restoring to this deserted
country its population, fertility, and happiness, that I think you
will see his conduct in the same light as I do when you are made
acquainted with the circumstances.”</p>

<p>It would be unjust alike to the father and the son to withhold
a letter which reflects so much credit upon them both—upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
the father for his humane measures, and upon the son for his appreciation
of their moral beauty.</p>

<p>The king was so pleased with the conduct of his son during
this journey that, in a moment of unusual good-nature, he made
him a present of a very extensive horse-breeding establishment
near Tilsit, consisting of seven farms, all in the most perfect order,
as every thing was sure to be which was under the control
of Frederick William. The profits of this establishment added
about ten thousand dollars to the annual income of the Crown
Prince. He was quite overjoyed at the unexpected gift, and
wrote to his sister Wilhelmina a letter glowing with satisfaction.</p>

<p>During the first part of his journey the king had been remarkably
cheerful and genial, but toward its close he was attacked
by a new fit of very serious illness. To the discomfort of all,
his chronic moodiness returned. A few extracts from Pöllnitz’s
account of this journey throws interesting light upon those
scenes:</p>

<p>“Till now his majesty has been in especial good-humor. But
in Dantzig his cheerfulness forsook him, and it never came back.
He arrived about ten o’clock at night in that city, slept there,
and was off again next morning at five. He drove only fifty
miles this day; stopped in Luppow. From Luppow he went
to a poor village near Belgard, and staid there overnight.</p>

<p>“At Belgard next morning he reviewed the dragoon regiment,
and was very ill content with it. And nobody, with the least
understanding of that business, but must own that never did
Prussian regiment manœuvre worse. Conscious themselves how
bad it was, they lost head and got into confusion. The king did
every thing that was possible to help them into order again,
but it was all in vain. The king, contrary to wont, restrained
himself amazingly, and would not show his displeasure in public.
He got into his carriage and drove away, not staying to
dine with General Von Platen, as was always his custom with
commandants whom he had reviewed.</p>

<p>“As the prince was anxious to come up with his majesty again,
and knew not where he would meet him, we had to be very
swift in the business. We found the king, with Anhalt and
Winterfeld, by-and-by, sitting in a village in front of a barn, eating
a cold pie there which the Marquis of Anhalt chanced to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
have with him. His majesty, owing to what he had seen on the
parade-ground, was in the utmost ill-humor. Next day, Saturday,
he went a hundred and fifty or two hundred miles, and arrived
in Berlin at ten o’clock at night, not expected there till the
morrow, so that his rooms were locked, her majesty being over
in Monbijou giving her children a ball.”</p>

<p>Late in the fall of 1739 the health of Frederick William was
so rapidly failing that it became manifest to all that his days on
earth would soon be ended. He sat joylessly in his palace, listening
to the moaning of the wind, the rustle of the falling leaves,
and the pattering of the rain. His gloomy spirit was in accord
with the melancholy days. More dreary storms darkened his
turbid soul than those which wrecked the autumnal sky.</p>

<p>Early in November he came to Berlin, languid, crippled, and
wretched. The death-chamber in the palace is attended with
all the humiliations and sufferings which are encountered in the
poor man’s hut. The king, through all his life, had indulged his
irritable disposition, and now, imprisoned by infirmities and tortured
with pain, his petulance and abuse became almost unendurable.
Miserable himself, he made every one wretched around
him. He was ever restless—now in his bed, now out of it, now
in his wheel-chair, continually finding fault, and often dealing
cruel blows to those who came within his reach. He was unwilling
to be left for a moment alone. The old generals were
gathered in his room, and sat around his bed talking and smoking.
He could not sleep at night, and allowed his attendants
no repose. Restlessly he tried to divert his mind by whittling,
painting, and small carpentry. The Crown Prince dared not
visit him too often, lest his solicitude should be interpreted into
impatience for the king to die, that he might grasp the crown.
In the grossest terms the king insulted his physicians, attributing
all his sufferings to their wickedness or their ignorance. Fortunately
the miserable old man was too weak to attempt to cane
them. A celebrated physician, by the name of Hoffman, was
sent for to prescribe for the king. He was a man of much intellectual
distinction, and occupied an important position in the
university. As his prescriptions failed to give relief to his majesty,
he was assailed, like the rest, in the vilest language of vituperation.
With great dignity Professor Hoffman replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
“Sire, I can not bear these reproaches, which I do not deserve.
I have tried, for the relief of your majesty, all the remedies which
art can supply, or which nature can admit. If my ability or my
integrity is doubted, I am willing to leave not only the university,
but the kingdom. But I can not be driven into any place
where the name of Hoffman will not be respected.”</p>

<p>The king was so impressed by this firm attitude of his physician
that he even made an apology for his rudeness. As Frederick
William was now convinced that ere long he must appear
before the tribunal of God, he gradually became a little more
calm and resigned.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> It is, however, evident that the Crown
Prince still had his share of earthly annoyances, and certainly
his full share of earthly frailties. In a letter to his friend Suhm,
written this summer, he says:</p>

<p>“Tantalus never suffered so much while standing in the river,
the waters of which he could not drink, as I when, having received
your package of the translation of Wolff, I was unable to
read it. All the accidents and all the bores in the world were,
I think, agreed to prevent me. A journey to Potsdam, daily reviews,
and the arrival of my brother in company with Messrs.
De Hacke and De Rittberg, have been my impediments. Imagine
my horror, my dear Diaphanes,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> at seeing the arrival of this
caravan without my having in the least expected them. They
weigh upon my shoulders like a tremendous burden, and never
quit my side, in order, I believe, to make me wish myself at the
devil.”</p>

<p>As the king’s infirmities and sufferings increased, the sympathies
of his son were more and more excited. He seemed to forget
all his father’s cruel treatment, and to remember only his
kingly energies. The thought of his death became very painful
to him, and at times he recoiled from the oppressive cares he
must of necessity assume with the crown.</p>

    <div class="caption">THE CROWN PRINCE ENTERING THE TOBACCO PARLIAMENT.</div></div>

<p>One evening in April, the king, feeling a little better, decided
to dress and hold a tobacco parliament, as formerly. Quite a
numerous party of his customary cabinet was assembled, and the
circle was full. The pipes were lighted; the king was in good-humor;
the beer-pots circulated merrily; and as every one made
an effort to be agreeable, the scene was unusually animated.
Quite unexpectedly, in the midst of the lively talk, the door
opened, and the Crown Prince entered. Simultaneously, as by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
common instinct, the whole company arose and bowed profoundly
to the young prince. The king was exceedingly annoyed.
Trembling with rage, he exclaimed,</p>

<p>“This is the homage you render the rising sun, though you
know that the rule in the tobacco parliament is to rise to no one.
You think I am dead. But I will teach you that I am yet living.”</p>

<p>Ringing violently for his servants, and deaf to all protestations
and excuses, he had himself immediately rolled from the room.
As the courtiers stood bewildered and gazing at each other in
consternation, an officer came in with an order from the king that
they should all leave the palace immediately, and come not back
again. The next morning Pöllnitz, who occupied a position
somewhat similar to that of prime minister, applied for admission
to his majesty’s apartment. But a gendarme seized him by
the shoulder and turned him around, saying, “There is no admittance.”
It was several days, and not till after repeated acts
of humiliation, that the king would permit any member of the
parliament again to enter his presence.</p>

<p>In the latter part of April, the weather being very fine, the
king decided to leave Berlin and retire to his rural palace at
Potsdam. It seems, however, that he was fully aware that his
days were nearly ended, for upon leaving the city he said, “Fare
thee well, then, Berlin; I am going to die in Potsdam.” The
winter had been one of almost unprecedented severity, and the
month of May was cold and wet. As the days wore on the
king’s health fluctuated, and he was continually struggling between
life and death. The king, with all his great imperfections,
was a thoughtful man. As he daily drew near the grave, the
dread realities of the eternal world oppressed his mind. He sent
for three clergymen of distinction, to converse with them respecting
his preparation for the final judgment. It seems that they
were very faithful with him, reminding him of his many acts of
violence and tyranny, alluding particularly to his hanging Baron
Schlubhut, at Königsberg, without even a trial. The king endeavored
to defend himself, saying,</p>

<p>“It is true that Schlubhut had no trial, but he certainly deserved
his doom. He was a public thief, stealing the taxes he
was sent to gather; insolently offering to repay, as if that were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
all the amends required; and saying that it was not good manners
to hang a nobleman.”</p>

<p>Still the clergymen pressed upon him his sins, his many acts
of oppression, his unrelenting and unforgiving spirit. Singularly
enough, most of the members of the tobacco parliament were
present at this strange interview; and some of them, courtier
like, endeavored to defend the king against several of the charges
brought against him. The king might emphatically be called a
good hater; and he hated his brother-in-law, the King of England,
perhaps with passion as implacable as ever took possession
of a human heart. In allusion to this, one of the clergymen,
M. Roloff, said,</p>

<p>“There is the forgiveness of enemies. Your majesty is bound
to forgive all men. If you do not do this, how can you ask to
be forgiven?”</p>

<p>The king had a logical mind. He could keenly feel where the
argument pinched. He seemed quite troubled. After a moment’s
pause, he said, “Well, I will do it.” Then, turning to the
queen, he said, “You, Phiekin, may write to your brother, <em>after
I am dead</em>, and tell him that I forgave him, and died at peace
with him.”</p>

<p>“It would be better,” M. Roloff mildly suggested, “that your
majesty should write at once.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the king, sternly and peremptorily. “Write after
I am dead. That will be safer.”</p>

<p>At parting, the king bore magnanimous testimony to the fidelity
of his spiritual advisers. He said to M. Roloff, who had been
the principal speaker, “You do not spare me. It is right. You
do your duty like an honest Christian man.”</p>

<p>For such a mind and such a body there could be no possible
peace or repose in the dying-chamber. Feverish, restless, sleepless,
impatient, he knew not what to do with himself. He was
incessantly passing from his bed to his wheel-chair and back
again, irascibly demanding this and that, complaining of every
body and every thing. Sometimes he would declare that he
would no longer be sick, but would dress and be well; and
scarcely would he get his clothes on ere he would sink in fainting
weakness, as though he had not another hour to live. Thus
the sad days of sickness wore away as death drew near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
On the 26th of May the Crown Prince received an express informing
him that his father was dying, and that he must hasten
to Potsdam with the utmost speed if he would ever again see
him alive. Reinsberg was about thirty miles north from Potsdam.
It took the courier some hours to reach the place. Frederick,
with emotions not easily imagined, started before the dawn
of the morning, followed by a train of attendants, to hasten to the
death-bed of his father, and to receive the kingly crown of Prussia.</p>

<p>As he reached Potsdam and turned the corner of the palace,
he saw, at a little distance, a small crowd gathered around some
object; and soon, to his inexpressible surprise, beheld his father,
dressed, in his wheel-chair, out of doors, giving directions about
laying the foundations of a house he had undertaken to build.
The old king, at the sight of his son, threw open his arms, and
Frederick, kneeling before him, buried his face in his fathers lap,
and they wept together. The affecting scene forced tears into
the eyes of all the by-standers. Frederick William, upon recovering
from a fainting-fit, had insisted that he would not die, and
had compelled his attendants to dress him and conduct him to
the open air.</p>

<p>But the exertion, and the emotion occasioned by the interview
with his son, prostrated him again. He was taken back into his
palace and to his bed more dead than alive. Reviving a little
in the afternoon, he dictated to Frederick all the arrangements
he wished to have adopted in reference to his funeral. This curious
document is characteristic, in every line, of the strange man.
His coffin, which was of massive oak carpentry, had been made
for some time, and was in the king’s chamber awaiting its occupant.
He not unfrequently, with affected or real complacency,
fixed his eyes upon it, saying, “I shall sleep right well there.”
In the minute directions to his son as to his burial, he said,</p>

<p>“As soon as I am dead, my body must be washed, a white
shirt must be placed upon it, and it must be stretched out upon
a table. They must then shave and wash me, and cover me
with a sheet. After four hours my body must be opened. The
surgeons of the regiments in town will examine into the malady
which has caused my death. They will then dress me in
my best clothes, with all my decorations. Then I am to be
placed in my coffin, and thus left all night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
“The next day the battalions will be formed in complete order,
each grenadier with three cartridges. Crape will be placed
about the colors, the drums, the fifes, and hautboys. Every officer
will have crape on his hat, around his arm, and on the hilt
of his sword. The funeral car will be placed near the green
staircase, with the heads of the horses toward the river. Eight
captains of my regiment will carry me toward the funeral car.
These eight captains will also take me out of the car, and carry
me into the church.</p>

<p>“As soon as the car shall begin to move, the drums shall beat
the dead march, and the hautboys shall play the well-known anthem,
‘O blessed head, covered with blood and wounds!’ The
car will stop at the iron gate. The regiment will defile before
it. My two sons, Augustus William and Henry, will remain with
the regiment. You, as my eldest son, with little Ferdinand, my
youngest son, will walk in uniform behind the car.</p>

<p>“When the body has been carried into the church, there shall
be placed upon the coffin my handsomest sword, my best scarf,
a pair of gilt spurs, and a gilt helmet. There shall be brought
from Berlin twenty-four six-pounders, which shall make twelve
discharges singly. Then the battalions will fire.</p>

<p>“I forbid any funeral sermon to be preached over me. In the
evening a festival will be given in the great room in the garden.
The cask of hock which I have in my cellar must be opened. At
this repast good wine alone shall be drank.</p>

<p>“A fortnight after a funeral sermon shall be preached for me
in all the churches. The text shall be, ‘I have fought a good
fight; I have finished my course; I have kept the faith.’ They
shall not speak any thing of my life, of my actions, nor any thing
personal of me. But they shall tell the people that I confessed
my sins, and that I died in full confidence of the goodness of
God and of my Savior.”</p>

<p>During the next three days the king suffered much from weakness
and a violent cough. He was often heard murmuring prayers,
and would say to those around him, “Pray for me; pray for
me.” Several times he pathetically exclaimed, “Lord, enter not
into judgment with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man
living be justified.” A favorite hymn was often sung to him
containing the words, “Naked came I into the world, and naked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
shall I go out of it.” At this passage he repeatedly exclaimed,
with much vivacity, as though it were an admirable joke, “No,
not quite naked; I shall have my uniform on.”</p>

<p>At one o’clock in the morning of May 31 he sent for a clergyman,
M. Cochius, and seemed to be in great distress both of body
and of mind. “I fear,” said he, “that I have a great deal of pain
yet to suffer. I can remember nothing. I can not pray. I have
forgotten all my prayers.” M. Cochius endeavored to console
him. At the close of the interview the king said, sadly, “Fare
thee well. We shall most probably never meet again in this
world.” He was then rolled, in his wheel-chair, into the chamber
of the queen.</p>

<p>“Oh, Phiekin, my Phiekin!” said he, “thou must rise and help
me what thou canst. This day I am going to die. Thou must
be with me this day.”</p>

<p>The dying king strangely decided, at that late hour, to abdicate.
All the officials were hurriedly summoned to his chamber.
The poor old man, bandaged, with his night-cap on, and a
mantle thrown over him, was wheeled into the anteroom where
the company was assembled. As he saw Pöllnitz he exclaimed,
sadly, “It is all over.” Noticing one in tears, he said to him,
kindly, “Nay, my friend, this is a debt we all have to pay.” The
king then solemnly abdicated in favor of his “good son Frederick.”
The deed was made out, signed, and sealed. But scarcely
was it executed ere the king fainted, and was carried to his
bed. Still the expiring lamp of life flickered in its socket.
About eleven o’clock the clergyman, M. Cochius, was sent for.
The king was in his bed, apparently speechless. He, however,
revived a little, and was in great pain, often exclaiming, “Pray
for me; pray for me; my trust is in the Savior.” He called for
a mirror, and carefully examined his face for some moments, saying
at intervals, “Not so worn out as I thought.” “An ugly
face.” “As good as dead already.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
He then summoned his physician, M. Pitsch, and said, “Feel
my pulse. Tell me how long this will last.”</p>

<p>The physician replied, “Alas! not long.”</p>

<p>“Say not alas,” added the king. “But how do you know?”</p>

<p>“The pulse is gone,” the physician said, sadly.</p>

<p>The king seemed surprised, raised his hand, opening and shutting
the fingers, and then said, “It is impossible. How could I
move my fingers so if the pulse were gone?”</p>

<p>M. Pitsch made no reply. The king, probably feeling at the
moment some physical monition of approaching death, cried out,
“Lord Jesus, to thee I live. Lord Jesus, to thee I die. In life
and in death thou art my gain.”</p>

<p>These were his last words. He fainted, and, after a few gasps,
died. It was about two o’clock in the afternoon of Tuesday, the
31st of May, 1740. Thus the soul of Frederick William passed
to the spirit land, in the fifty-first year of its sojourn here on earth.</p>

<p>The king having breathed his last, Frederick, in tears, retired
to a private room, there to reflect upon the sad receding past,
and upon the opening future, with the vast responsibilities thus
suddenly thrown upon him. He was now King of Prussia; and
not only absolute master of himself, but absolute monarch over
a realm containing two millions two hundred and forty thousand
souls. He was restrained by no Parliament, no Constitution,
no customs or laws superior to his own resolves. He could
take advice of others, and call energetic men to his aid, but his
will alone was sovereign.</p>

<p>The Prussian kingdom, which thus fell to Frederick by “divine
right,” consisted of an assemblage of duchies, marquisates,
principalities, and lordships, comprising an area of nearly fifty-seven
thousand square miles, being about the size of the State
of Michigan, and very similarly situated as to climate and soil.
It was unfortunately not a compact country, as several of the
states could only be reached by passing through the territories
of other powers. The annual revenue amounted to a little over
six million dollars. There was also in the treasury a sum, which
Frederick William had saved, of about seven million dollars.
The army consisted of seventy-six thousand men, in the highest
state of discipline, and abundantly furnished with all the <em>materiel</em>
of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
Quite an entire change seemed immediately to take place in
the character of the young king. M. Bielfeld was the first who
was introduced to his apartment after the death of Frederick
William. Frederick was in tears, and seemed much affected.</p>

<p>“You do not know,” said he to M. Bielfeld, “what I have lost
in losing my father.”</p>

<p>“It is true, sire,” Bielfeld replied, “but I know very well what
you have gained in getting a kingdom. Your loss is great, but
your motives for consolation are very powerful.”</p>

<p>The king smiled, and immediately entered very vigorously
upon business. It was not possible, under these circumstances,
for him deeply to mourn over the death of so tyrannical a father.
Frederick was twenty-eight years of age. He is described as a
handsome young man, five feet seven inches in stature, and of
graceful presence. The funeral ceremonies of the deceased monarch
were conducted essentially according to the programme already
given. The body of the king mouldered to dust in the
sepulchre of his fathers. His spirit returned to the God who
gave it.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“The mind is its own place, and in itself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>If these words are true, which Milton places in the lips of the
apostate fiend, it is appalling to think of the ungoverned and ungovernable
spirit with which the king entered the unseen world.
We know not that there is any power in the alembic of death
to transform the character; and certain it is that if Frederick
William carried with him to the abode of spirits the same character
which he cherished in this world, there are but few who
could be rendered happy by his society. But we must leave
him with his God, and return to the stormy scenes upon which
his son now entered.</p>

<p>The young sovereign commenced his reign with the utterance
of very noble sentiments. The day after his accession he assembled
the chief officers of his father to administer to them the oath
of allegiance. He urged them to be humane in the exercise of
all authority which might be delegated to them.</p>

<p>“Our grand care,” said he, “will be to further the country’s
well-being, and to make every one of our subjects contented and
happy. If it ever chance that my particular interest and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
general good of my country should seem to conflict, it is my wish
that the latter should always be preferred.”</p>

of the King.—Journey to Strasbourg.—First Interview with Voltaire.</p></blockquote>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">The</span> conduct of Frederick the Second, upon his accession to
the throne, was in accordance with his professions. The winter
had been intensely cold. The spring was late and wet. There
was almost a famine in the land. The public granaries, which
the foresight of his father had established, contained large stores
of grain, which were distributed to the poor at very low prices.
A thousand aged and destitute women in Berlin were provided
with rooms, well warmed, where they spun in the service of the
king, with good wages, and in their grateful hearts ever thanking
their benefactor. He abolished the use of <em>torture</em> in criminal
trials, not forgetting that he himself had come very near having
his limbs stretched upon the rack. This important decree,
which was hailed with joy all over Prussia, was issued the third
day after his accession.</p>

<p>Very vigorous measures were immediately adopted to establish
an Academy of Sciences. The celebrated French philosopher
Maupertuis, who had just obtained great renown from measuring
a degree of the meridian at the polar circle, was invited
to organize this very important institute. The letter to the philosopher,
written by the king but a few days after his accession,
was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“My heart and my inclination excited in me, from the moment
I mounted the throne, the desire of having you here, that
you might put our Berlin Academy in the shape you alone are
capable of giving it. Come then, come, and insert into this wild
crab-tree the sciences, that it may bear fruit. You have shown
the figure of the earth to mankind; show also to a king how
sweet it is to possess such a man as you.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“Monsieur De Maupertuis, your very affectionate</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Frederick</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
On the 22d of June a complaint was made to the king that
the Roman Catholic schools were perverted to seducing Protestants
to become Catholics. Frederick returned the complaint
with the following words written upon the margin:</p>

<p>“All religions must be tolerated, and the king’s solicitor must
have an eye that none of them make unjust encroachments on
the other; for in this country every man must get to heaven his
own way.”</p>

<p>It is a fact worthy of mention, as illustrative of the neglect
with which the king had regarded his own German language in
his devotion to the French tongue, that in these three lines there
were eleven words wrongly spelled.</p>

<p>But the good sense of the utterance, so rare in those dark
days, electrified thousands of minds. It drew the attention of
Europe to Frederick, and gave him wide-spread renown.</p>

<p>Under Frederick William the newspaper press in Berlin
amounted to nothing. The capital had not a single daily paper.
Speedy destruction would crush any writer who, in journal,
pamphlet, or book, should publish any thing displeasing to the
king. Frederick proclaimed freedom of the press. Two newspapers
were established in Berlin, one in French and one in German.
Distinguished men were selected to edit them. One was
a noted writer from Hamburg. Frederick, in his absolutism,
had adopted the resolve not to interfere with the freedom of the
press unless there were some gross violation of what he deemed
proper. He allowed very bitter satires to be circulated in Berlin
against himself, simply replying to the remonstrances of his
ministers, “<em>The press is free</em>.”</p>

<p>Such were the measures adopted during the first week of
Frederick’s reign. He soon abolished the enormously expensive
regiment of giants, and organized, instead of them, four regiments
composed of men of the usual stature.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Within a few months
he added sixteen thousand men to his already large army, thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
raising the number of the standing army of his little realm to
over ninety thousand men. He compelled his old associates to
feel, and some of them very keenly, that he was no longer their
comrade, but their king. One of the veteran and most honored
officers of Frederick William, in his expressions of condolence
and congratulation, ventured to suggest the hope that he and
his sons might continue to “occupy the same posts and retain
the same authority as in the last reign.”</p>

<p>“You will retain your <em>posts</em>,” said the king, severely. “I have
no thought of making any change. But as to <em>authority</em>, I know
of none there can be but what resides in the king that is sovereign.”</p>

<p>The Marquis of Schwedt advanced to meet the new-made sovereign,
his face beaming jovially, and with outstretched hands,
as in the days of their old companionship. Frederick, fixing his
cold eye steadfastly upon him, almost floored him with the rebuff,
“My cousin, I am now king.”</p>

<p>General Schulenburg, trembling in memory of the fact that he
had once, in court-martial, given his vote in favor of beheading
the Crown Prince, hastened from his post at Landsberg to congratulate
the prince upon his accession to the throne. To his
extreme chagrin and indignation, he was repelled by the words,
“An officer should not quit his post without order. Return immediately
to Landsberg.”</p>

<p>As an administrative officer the young sovereign was inexorable
and heartless in the extreme. Those who had befriended
him in the days of his adversity were not remembered with any
profusion of thanks or favors. Those who had been in sympathy
with his father in his persecution of the Crown Prince encountered
no spirit of revenge. Apparently dead to affection,
and oblivious of the past, the young sovereign only sought for
those agents who could best assist him in the work to which he
now consecrated all his energies—the endeavor to aggrandize
the kingdom of Prussia. Poor Doris Ritter received but a trivial
pension for her terrible wrongs. Lieutenant Keith, his friend
and confederate in his contemplated flight, who had barely escaped
with his life from Wesel, after ten years of exile hastened
home, hoping that his faithful services and sufferings would meet
with a reward. The king appointed him merely lieutenant colonel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
with scarcely sufficient income to keep him from absolute
want. Perhaps the king judged that the young man was not
capable of filling, to the advantage of the state, a higher station,
and he had no idea of sacrificing his interests to gratitude.</p>

<p>Ten years later the king made poor Keith a present of a purse
of gold, containing about seven thousand dollars, under circumstances
which reflected much credit upon the donor. In the following
quaint style Carlyle records the incident:</p>

<p>“The king did a beautiful thing to Lieutenant Keith the other
day—that poor Keith who was nailed to the gallows, in effigy,
for him at Wesel, long ago, and got far less than he expected.
The other day there had been a grand review, part of it extending
into Madame Knyphausen’s grounds, who is Keith’s mother-in-law.</p>

<p>“‘Monsieur Keith,’ said the king to him, ‘I am sorry we had
to spoil Madame’s fine shrubbery by our manœuvres; have the
goodness to give her that, with my apologies,’ and handed him
a pretty casket with key to it, and in the interior 10,000 crowns.</p>

<p>“Not a shrub of Madame’s had been cut or injured. But the
king, you see, would count it £1500 of damage done, and here is
acknowledgment for it, which please accept. Is not that a gracious
little touch?”</p>

<p>One wretched man, who had been the guilty accomplice of the
Crown Prince in former scenes of guilt and shame, was so troubled
by the neglect with which he was treated that he hanged
himself.</p>

<p>Frederick, as Crown Prince, had been quite methodical in the
distribution of his time, and had cultivated rigid habits of industry.
Now, fully conscious of the immense duties and cares
which would devolve upon him as king, he entered into a very
systematic arrangement of the employments of each hour, to
which he rigidly adhered during nearly the whole of his reign
of forty-six years. He ordered his servants to wake him at four
o’clock every morning. Being naturally inclined to sleep, he
found it hard to shake off his lethargy. The attendants were
therefore directed, every morning, to place upon his forehead a
towel dipped in cold water. He thus continued to rise at four
o’clock, summer and winter, until an advanced age.</p>

<p>A single servant lighted his fire, shaved him, and dressed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
hair. He always wore the uniform of his guards, and allowed
only fifteen minutes for his morning toilet. He did not indulge
in the luxury of slippers or dressing-gown, though occasionally,
when ill, he put on a sort of linen wrapper, but even then he
wore his military boots. Only on one day in the year did he
appear in silk stockings, and that was on the birthday of his
neglected wife, when he formally called upon her with his congratulations.</p>

<p>The ordinary routine of the day, when not absent on travels
or campaigns, was as follows: As soon as dressed, one of his
pages brought the packet of letters. The number was usually
very large. He employed himself in reading these letters till
eight o’clock. By a particular style of folding, he designated
those to which no reply was to be returned, those to which there
was to be an immediate reply, and those which required further
consideration. At eight o’clock one of the four secretaries of
the cabinet entered, took the three parcels, and, while the king
was breakfasting, received from him very briefly the character
of the response to be made.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock Frederick received one of the general officers,
and arranged with him all the military affairs of the day, usually
dismissing him loaded with business. At ten o’clock he reviewed
some one of the regiments; and then, after attending parade,
devoted himself to literary pursuits or private correspondence
until dinner-time. This was the portion of the day he usually
appropriated to authorship. He was accustomed to compose,
both in prose and verse, while slowly traversing the graveled
walks of his garden.</p>

<p>He was particularly fond of dogs of the graceful greyhound
breed, and might often be seen with book and pencil in his hand,
in the shady walks, with three or four Italian greyhounds gamboling
around him, apparently entirely absorbed in deep meditation.
A page usually followed at a short distance behind, to
attend his call. At twelve o’clock he dined with invited guests.
As quite a number of distinguished men always met at his table,
and the king was very fond of good living, as well as of the
“feast of reason and the flow of soul,” the repast was frequently
prolonged until nearly three o’clock. At dinner he was very social,
priding himself not a little upon his conversational powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>

<div id="ip_196" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img src="images/i_196.jpg" width="350" height="459" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">FREDERICK IN THE GARDEN.</div></div>

<p>In pleasant weather he took a long walk after dinner, and
generally at so rapid a pace that it was difficult for most persons
to keep up with him. At four o’clock the secretaries brought
to him the answers to the letters which they had received from
him in the morning. He glanced them over, examining some
with care. Then, until six o’clock, he devoted himself to reading,
to literary compositions, and to the affairs of the Academy, in
which he took a very deep interest. At six o’clock he had a
private musical concert, at which he performed himself upon the
flute. He was passionately fond of this instrument, and continued
to play upon it until, in old age, his teeth decaying, he was
unable to produce the sounds he wished.</p>

<p>After the concert, which usually continued an hour, he engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
in conversation until ten o’clock. He then took supper
with a few friends, and at eleven retired to his bed.</p>

<p>To his mother he was very considerate in all his manifestations
of filial affection, while, at the same time, he caused her
very distinctly to understand that she was to take no share
whatever in the affairs of government. When she addressed
him, upon his accession to the throne, as “Your Majesty,” he replied,
“Call me son. That is the title of all others most agreeable
to me.” He decreed to her the title of “Her Majesty the
Queen-mother.” The palace of Monbijou was assigned her,
where she was surrounded with every luxury, treated with the
most distinguished attention, and her court was the acknowledged
centre of fashionable society.</p>

<p>He seems ever to have treated his nominal wife, Queen Elizabeth,
<em>politely</em>. For some months after the accession he was quite
prominent in his public attentions to her. But these intervals
of association grew gradually more rare, until after three or four
years they ceased almost entirely.</p>

<p>Frederick, under the tutelage of his stern father, had not enjoyed
the privileges of foreign travel. While other princes of
far humbler expectations were taking the grand tour of Europe,
the Crown Prince was virtually imprisoned in the barracks, day
after day, engaged in the dull routine of drilling the giant guard.
After the death of his father he did not condescend to be crowned,
proudly assuming, in contradiction to some of his earlier
teachings, that the crown was already placed upon his brow by
divine power. He, however, exacted from the people throughout
his realms oaths of allegiance, and in person visited several
of the principal cities to administer those oaths with much pomp
of ceremony. The Danish envoy, writing home to his government
respecting the administration of Frederick, says,</p>

<p>“I must observe that hitherto the King of Prussia does, as it
were, every thing himself; and that, excepting the finance minister,
who preaches frugality, and finds for that doctrine uncommon
acceptance, his majesty allows no counseling from any minister;
so that the minister for foreign affairs has nothing to do
but to expedite the orders he receives, his advice not being asked
upon any matter. And so it is with the other ministers.”</p>

<p>On the 12th of June, but a fortnight after his accession, Frederick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
wrote from Charlottenburg to Voltaire, who was then at
Brussels, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Voltaire</span>,—Resist no longer the eagerness I have
to see you. Do, in my favor, whatever your humanity allows.
In the end of August I go to Wesel, and perhaps farther. Promise
that you will come and join me, for I could not live happy
nor die tranquil without having embraced you. Thousand compliments
to the Marquise” (Madame Du Châtelet, the <em>divine
Emilie</em>). “I am busy with both hands—working at the army
with one hand, at the people and the fine arts with the other.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It would seem that Frederick was not very willing to receive,
as his guest, the divine Emilie, who occupied so questionable a
position in the household of Voltaire; for he wrote again, on the
5th of August, in reply to a letter from Voltaire, saying,</p>

<p>“I will write to Madame Du Châtelet in compliance with your
wish. To speak to you frankly concerning her journey, it is Voltaire,
it is you, it is my friend that I desire to see. I can not say
whether I shall travel or not travel. Adieu, dear friend, sublime
spirit, first-born of thinking beings. Love me always sincerely,
and be persuaded that none can love and esteem you more
than I.”</p>

<p>Again the next day he wrote:</p>

<p>“You will have received a letter from me dated yesterday.
This is the second I write to you from Berlin. I refer you to
what was in the other. If it must be that Emilie accompany
Apollo, I consent. But if I could see you alone, that is what I
should prefer. I should be too much dazzled. I could not stand
so much splendor all at once. It would overpower me. I should
need the veil of Moses to temper the united radiance of your
two divinities.”</p>

<p>In return, Voltaire compliments the king very profusely.
Speaking of the book of the royal author, the <cite>Anti-Machiavel</cite>,
he writes:</p>

<p>“It is a monument for the latest posterity; the only book
worthy of a king for these fifteen hundred years.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
Frederick was very desirous of visiting France, whose literature,
science, and distinguished men he so greatly admired. Early
Monday morning, the 15th of August, the king left Potsdam
to visit his sister Wilhelmina, intending then to continue his journey
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">incognito</i> into France, and, if circumstances favored, as far as
Paris. The king assumed the name of the Count Dufour. His
next younger brother, William, eighteen years of age, accompanied
him, also under an assumed name. William was now Crown
Prince, to inherit the throne should Frederick leave no children.
Six other gentlemen composed the party. They traveled in two
coaches, with but few attendants, and avoided all unnecessary
display.</p>

<p>Frederick spent three days with his sister at Baireuth. Wilhelmina
was disappointed in his appearance. The brotherly affection
she looked for was not found. He was cold, stately, disposed
to banter her, and his conversation seemed “set on stilts.”
Leaving Baireuth, the king continued his journey very rapidly
toward Strasbourg. When they reached Kehl, on the eastern
banks of the Rhine, they were informed that they could not cross
the river without passports. One of the gentlemen drew up the
necessary document, which the king signed and sealed with his
signet-ring. The curiosity of the landlord had been excited, and
he watched his guests from a closet. Seeing what was done, he
said to Frederstorf, the king’s valet, “Count Dufour is the King
of Prussia, sir; I saw him sign his name.” He was bribed to
keep the secret.</p>

<p>When they reached Strasbourg they provided themselves with
French dresses. The king and his brother put up at different
inns, that they might be less liable to suspicion. Frederick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
with several of his party, took lodgings at the Raven Hotel. He
sent the landlord out to invite several army officers to sup with
a foreign gentleman, Count Dufour, from Bohemia, who was an
entire stranger in the place. Some of the officers very peremptorily
declined the invitation, considering it an imposition. Three,
however, allured by the singularity of the summons, repaired to
the inn. The assumed count received them with great courtesy,
apologized for the liberty he had taken, thanked them for their
kindness, and assured them that, being a stranger, he was very
happy to make the acquaintance of so many brave officers, whose
society he valued above that of all others.</p>

<p>The companions of the king were well-bred men, of engaging
manners, commanding intelligence, and accustomed to authority.
The entertainment was superb, with an abundance of the richest
wines. The conversation took a wide range, and was interesting
and exciting to a high degree. The French officers were quite
bewildered by the scene. The count was perfect master of the
French language, was very brilliant in his sallies, and seemed
perfectly familiar with all military affairs. He was treated with
remarkable deference by his companions, some of whom were
far his superiors in years.</p>

<p>The entertainment was prolonged until a late hour of the
night. The delighted guests, as they retired, urged their host to
attend parade with them in the morning, offering to come in person
to conduct him to the ground. The count, with pleasure,
accepted the invitation. In the morning he was escorted to the
parade-ground. His fame spread rapidly. Friends multiplied.
He was invited to sup with the officers in the evening, and accepted
the invitation. Marshal Broglio, a very stately gentleman
of seventy years, was military governor at Strasbourg. The
count and one of his companions, the distinguished philosopher
Count Algarotti, were invited to dine with the marshal. The
supper given in the evening by the officers was brilliant. They
then repaired to the opera. A poor little girl came to the box
with a couple of lottery tickets for sale. Frederick gave her
four ducats ($25), and tore up the tickets.</p>

<p>Strasbourg began to echo with the fame of this foreign count.
But the next morning, Thursday, August 25, as Marshal Broglio
was walking on the Esplanade, a soldier, who had formerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
been in the regiment of the Crown Prince at Potsdam, and who
knew the Crown Prince perfectly, having seen him hundreds of
times, but who had deserted and entered the French service,
came to the marshal, with much bowing and embarrassment, and
assured him that Count Dufour was no less than the King of
Prussia.</p>

<p>The secret was now out. The tidings flew in all directions
that the King of Prussia was in Strasbourg <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">incognito</i>. The
king, not yet aware of the detection, called upon the marshal.
A crowd of officers gathered eagerly around. The marshal was
much embarrassed in his desire to respect the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">incognito</i>, and also
to manifest the consideration due to a sovereign. No one yet
ventured to address him as king, though there were many indications
that his rank was beginning to be known. Frederick
therefore decided to get out of the city as soon as possible. To
conceal his design, he made arrangements to attend the theatre
with the marshal in the evening. The marshal went to the theatre
with all his officers. The building was crowded with the
multitude hoping to see the king. Bonfires began to blaze in
the streets, and shouts were heard of “Long live the King of
Prussia.” Frederick hastily collected his companions, paid his
enormous bill at the Raven, “shot off like lightning,” and was
seen in Strasbourg no more.</p>

<p>Voltaire was at this time in Brussels. Frederick wrote him
from Wesel, under date of 2d September, 1740, giving a narrative
of his adventures, partly in prose, partly in verse. It was a
long communication, the rhyme very much like that which a
bright school-girl would write upon the gallop. The following
specimen of this singular production will give the reader a sufficient
idea of the whole:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Voltaire</span>,—You wish to know what I have been
about since leaving Berlin. Annexed you will find a description
of it.</p>

<p>“I have just finished a journey intermingled with singular adventures,
sometimes pleasant, sometimes the reverse. You know
I had set out for Baireuth to see a sister whom I love no less
than esteem. On the road Algarotti and I consulted the map
to settle our route for returning by Wesel. Frankfort-on-the-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>Main
comes always as a principal stage. Strasbourg was no
great roundabout. We chose that route in preference. The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">incognito</i>
was decided, names pitched upon, story we were to tell.
In fine, all was arranged as well as possible. We fancied we
should get to Strasbourg in three days.</p>

<div class="center-block"><div class="ilb">
<p class="iq">“Mais le ciel, qui de tout dispose,<br />
Régla différemment la chose.<br />
Avec de coursiers efflanqués,<br />
Et des paysans en postillons masqués,<br />
Butors de race impertinente,<br />
Notre carrosse en cent lieux accroché,<br />
Nous allions gravement d’une allure indolente,<br />
Gravitant contre les rochers,<br />
L’airs émus par le bruyant tonnere.<br />

<p class="in0">(But Heaven, which of all disposes,<br />

</p>
</div></div>

<p>“Had all our fatalities been limited to stoppages of speed on
the journey, we should have taken patience. But after frightful
roads we found lodgings still more frightful.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Then came another strain of verse. Thus the prose and the
doggerel were interspersed through the long narrative. Though
very truthful in character, it was a school-boy performance—a
very singular document indeed to be sent to the most brilliant
genius of that age, by one who soon proved himself to be the
ablest sovereign in Europe.</p>

<p>At Wesel the king met Maupertuis, to whom we have already
alluded, who was then one of the greatest of European celebrities.
His discovery of the flattening of the earth at the poles
had given him such renown that the kings of Russia, France,
and Prussia were all lavishing honors upon him. It was a great
gratification to Frederick that he had secured his services in organizing
the Berlin Academy. While at Wesel the king was
seized by a fever, which shut him up for a time in the small
chateau of Moyland. He had never yet met Voltaire, and being
very anxious to see him, wrote to him as follows, under date of
September 6th, 1740:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p><blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Voltaire</span>,—In spite of myself, I have to yield to
the quartan fever, which is more tenacious than a Jansenist.
And whatever desire I had of going to Antwerp and Brussels,
I find myself not in a condition to undertake such a journey
without risk. I would ask of you, then, if the road from Brussels
to Cleves would not to <em>you</em> seem too long for a meeting?
It is the one means of seeing you which remains to me. Confess
that I am unlucky; for now, when I could dispose of my
person, and nothing hinders me from seeing you, the fever gets
its hand into the business, and seems to intend disputing me
that satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Let us deceive the fever, my dear Voltaire, and let me have
at least the pleasure of embracing you. Make my best excuses
to Madame the Marquise that I can not have the satisfaction of
seeing her at Brussels. All that are about me know the intention
I was in, which certainly nothing but the fever could make
me change.</p>

<p>“Sunday next I shall be at a little place near Cleves, where I
shall be able to possess you at my ease. If the sight of you
don’t cure me, I will send for a confessor at once. Adieu. You
know my sentiments and my heart.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Frederick.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>In accordance with this request, Voltaire repaired to Cleves to
visit the king. Many years afterward, having quarreled with
Frederick, and being disposed to represent him in the most unfavorable
light, he gave the following account of this interview
in his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vie Privée</i>:</p>

<p>“The king said that he would come and see me <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">incognito</i> at
Brussels. But having fallen ill a couple of leagues from Cleves,
he wrote me that he expected I would make the advances. I
went accordingly to present my profound homages. I found at
the gate of the court-yard a single soldier on guard. The privy
councilor Rambonet, Minister of State, was walking about the
court, blowing on his fingers to warm them. He had on great
ruffles of dirty linen, a hat with holes in it, and an old periwig,
one end of which hung down into one of his pockets, while the
other hardly covered his shoulder.</p>

<p>“I was conducted into his majesty’s apartment, where there
was nothing but the bare walls. I perceived in a closet, lit by
a single wax candle, a small bed, two feet and a half wide, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
which lay a little man wrapped up in a cloak of coarse blue
cloth. It was the king, who perspired and shivered, under a
miserable coverlet, in a violent access of fever. I made my bow,
and began the acquaintance by feeling his pulse, as if I had been
his first physician. When the fit was passed he dressed himself
and came to supper. Algarotti, Keyserling, Maupertuis, and the
king’s embassador to the States General made up the party.
We talked learnedly respecting the immortality of the soul, liberty,
and the Androgynes of Plato, and other small topics of that
nature.”</p>

    <div class="caption">FREDERICK’S FIRST INTERVIEW WITH VOLTAIRE.</div></div>

<p>Frederick, who was then in the zenith of his admiration for
Voltaire, describes as follows, in a letter to his friend M. Jordan,
his impressions of the interview:</p>

<p>“I have at length seen Voltaire, whom I was so anxious to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
know. But, alas! I saw him when under the influence of my
fever, and when my mind and my body were equally languid.
With persons like him one ought not to be sick. On the contrary,
one ought to be specially well. He has the eloquence of
Cicero, the mildness of Pliny, and the wisdom of Agrippa. He
unites, in a word, all the collected virtues and talents of the three
greatest men of antiquity. His intellect is always at work.
Every drop of ink that falls from his pen is transformed at once
into wit. He declaimed his <em>Mahomet</em> to us, an admirable tragedy
which he has composed. I could only admire in silence.”</p>

<p>Indeed, it would seem that, at the time, Voltaire must have
been very favorably impressed by the appearance of his royal
host. The account he then gave of the interview was very different
from that which, in his exasperation, he wrote twenty
years afterward. In a letter to a friend, M. De Cideville, dated
October 18th, 1740, Voltaire wrote:</p>

<p>“When you sent me, inclosed in your letter, those verses for
our Marcus Aurelius of the North, I fully intended to pay my
court to him with them. He was at that time to have come to
Brussels <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">incognito</i>. But the quartan fever, which unhappily he
still has, deranged all his projects. He has sent me a courier to
Brussels, and so I set out to find him in the neighborhood of
Cleves.</p>

<p>“It was there that I saw one of the most amiable men in the
world, who forms the charm of society, who would be every
where sought after if he were not a king; a philosopher without
austerity, full of sweetness, complaisance, and obliging ways—not
remembering that he is king when he meets his friends; indeed,
so completely forgetting it that he made me too almost
forget it, and I needed an effort of memory to recollect that I
here saw, sitting at the foot of my bed, a sovereign who had an
army of a hundred thousand men.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">The Herstal Affair.—The Summons.—Voltaire’s Manifesto.—George II. visits Hanover.—The
Visit of Wilhelmina to Berlin.—Unpopularity of the King.—Death of the Emperor Charles
VI.</p></blockquote>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">On</span> the River Maas, a few miles north of the present city of
Liege, there was a celebrated castle called Herstal. For many
generations feudal lords had there displayed their pomp and
power; and it had been the theatre not only of princely revelry,
but of many scenes of violence and blood. A surrounding territory
of a few thousand acres, cultivated by serfs, who were virtually
slaves, was the hereditary domain of the petty lords of the
castle. A few miles south of the castle there was a monastery
called Liege, which was a dependency of the lords of Herstal.</p>

<p>Amid the vicissitudes of the revolving centuries the rollicking
lords grew poor, and the frugal monks grew rich. A thrifty
city rose around the monastery, and its bishop wielded a power,
temporal and spiritual, more potent than had ever issued from
the walls of the now crumbling and dilapidated castle. In some
of the perplexing diplomatic arrangements of those days, the castle
of Herstal, with its surrounding district, was transferred to
Frederick William of Prussia. The peasants, who had heard of
the military rigor of Prussia, where almost every able-bodied
man was crowded into the army, were exceedingly troubled by
this transfer, and refused to take the oath of allegiance to their
new sovereign, who had thus succeeded to the ownership of
themselves, their flocks, and their herds. The gleaming sabres
of Frederick William’s dragoons soon, however, brought them to
terms. Thus compelled to submission, they remained unreconciled
and irritated. Upon the withdrawal of the Prussian troops,
the authority of Frederick William over the Herstal people also
disappeared, for they greatly preferred the milder rule of the
Bishop of Liege.</p>

<p>The bishop denied that Frederick William had any claim to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
Herstal. He brought forward a prior claim of his own in behalf
of the Church. The Duke of Lorraine, when proprietor of
the castle and its dependencies, had pawned it to the bishop for
a considerable sum of money. This money, the bishop averred,
had never been repaid. Consequently he claimed the property
as still in his possession.</p>

<p>George Ludwig, Count of Berg, who at this time was Bishop
of Liege, was a feeble old man, tottering beneath the infirmities
of eighty-two years. He did not venture upon physical resistance
to the power of Prussia, but confined himself to protests,
remonstrances, and to the continued exercise of his own governmental
authority. As Herstal was many leagues distant from
Berlin, was of comparatively little value, and could only be reached
by traversing foreign states, Frederick William offered to sell
all his claims to it for about eighty thousand dollars. The proposal
not being either accepted or rejected by the bishop, the
king, anxious to settle the question before his death, sent an embassador
to Liege, with full powers to arrange the difficulty by
treaty. For three days the embassador endeavored in vain to
obtain an audience. He then returned indignantly to Berlin.
The king, of course, regarded this treatment as an insult. The
bishop subsequently averred that the audience was prevented
by his own sickness. Such was the posture of affairs when Frederick
William died.</p>

<p>Upon the accession of Frederick the Second, as officers were
dispatched through the realm to exact oaths of allegiance, the
Herstal people, encouraged by the bishop, refused to acknowledge
fealty to the new king. Frederick was now in the district
of Cleve, in the near vicinity of Herstal. He sent the following
very decisive summons to the “Prince Bishop of Liege,” dated
Wesel, September 4, 1740:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Cousin</span>,—Knowing all the assaults made by you upon
my indisputable rights over my free barony of Herstal, and how
the seditious ringleaders there, for several years past, have been
countenanced by you in their detestable acts of disobedience
against me, I have commanded my privy counselor, Rambonet,
to repair to your presence, and in my name to require from you,
within two days, a distinct and categorical answer to this question:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
“Whether you are still minded to assert your pretended sovereignty
over Herstal, and whether you will protect the rebels
at Herstal in their disorders and abominable disobedience?</p>

<p>“In case you refuse, or delay beyond the term, the answer
which I hereby of right demand, you will render yourself alone
responsible, before the world, for the consequences which infallibly
will follow. I am, with much consideration, my cousin, your
very affectionate cousin,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Frederick</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Rambonet presented the peremptory missive, and waited forty-eight
hours for the answer. He then returned to Wesel without
any satisfactory reply. Frederick immediately issued a manifesto,
declaring the reasons for his action, and ordered two thousand
men, horse and foot, who were all ready for the emergence,
to advance immediately to Maaseyk, one of the principal towns
of the bishop, take possession of it and of the surrounding region,
quarter themselves upon the people, enforce liberal contributions,
and remain there until the bishop should come to terms.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>The solid, compact army, with infantry, artillery, and cavalry
in the best possible condition, advanced at the double-quick.
Arriving at the gates of Maaseyk, not a moment was spent in
parleying. “Open the gates instantly,” was the summons, “or
we shall open them with the petard.”</p>

<p>With great courtesy of words, but pitiless energy of action,
General Borck, who was in command, fulfilled his commission.
A contribution was exacted of fifteen thousand dollars, to be
paid within three days; sufficient rations were to be furnished
daily for the troops, or the general, it was stated, would be under
the painful necessity of collecting them for himself. Two
hundred and fifty dollars a day were to be provided for the general’s
private expenses. Remonstrances were of no avail. Resistance
was not to be thought of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
The poor old bishop called loudly upon the Emperor of Germany
for help. The territory of the Bishop of Liege was under
the protection of the empire. The Emperor Charles VI. immediately
issued a decree ordering Frederick to withdraw his
troops, to restore the money which he had extorted, and to settle
the question by arbitration, or by an appeal to the laws of
the empire. This was the last decree issued by Charles VI.
Two weeks after he died.</p>

<p>Frederick paid no regard to the remonstrance of the emperor.
The bishop, in his distress, applied to the French for aid, and
then to the Dutch, but all in vain. He then sent an embassy
to Berlin, proposing to purchase Herstal. The king consented
to sell upon the same terms his father had offered, adding to the
sum the expenses of his military expedition and other little items,
bringing the amount up to one hundred and eighty thousand
dollars. The money was paid, and the Herstal difficulty was
settled. This was Frederick’s first act of foreign diplomacy.
Many severely censured him for the violent course he pursued
with a power incapable of resistance. All admitted the energy
and sagacity which he had developed in the affair.</p>

<p>Voltaire, in his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, says that he drew up the manifesto
for Frederick upon this occasion. “The pretext,” he writes, “for
this fine expedition was certain rights which his majesty pretended
to have over a part of the suburbs. It was to me he committed
the task of drawing up the manifesto, which I performed
as well as the nature of the case would let me, never suspecting
that a king, with whom I supped, and who called me his friend,
could possibly be in the wrong. The affair was soon brought
to a conclusion by the payment of a million of livres, which he
exacted in good hard ducats, and which served to defray the expenses
of his tour to Strasbourg, concerning which he complained
so loudly in his poetic prose epistle.</p>

<p>“I represented to him that perhaps it was not altogether prudent
to print his <cite>Anti-Machiavel</cite> just at the time that the world
might reproach him with having violated the principles he
taught. He permitted me to stop the impression. I accordingly
took a journey into Holland purposely to do him this trifling
service. But the bookseller demanded so much money that his
majesty, who was not in the bottom of his heart vexed to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
himself in print, was better pleased to be so for nothing, than to
pay for not being so. I could not avoid feeling some remorse at
being concerned in printing this <cite>Anti-Machiavelian</cite> book at the
very moment that the King of Prussia, who had a hundred millions
in his coffers, was robbing the poor people of Liege of another,
by the hand of the privy counselor Rambonet.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that these words were written after
Voltaire had quarreled with Frederick, and when it seems to
have been his desire to represent all the acts of the king in as
unfavorable a light as possible. Frederick himself, about eight
years after the settlement of the Herstal difficulty, gave the following
as his version of the affair:</p>

<p>“A miserable Bishop of Liege thought it a proud thing to insult
the late king. Some subjects of Herstal, which belongs to
Prussia, had revolted. The bishop gave them his protection.
Colonel Kreutzen was sent to Liege to compose the thing by
treaty, with credentials and full power. Imagine it; the bishop
would not receive him! Three days, day after day, he saw this
envoy apply at his palace, and always denied him entrance.
These things had grown past endurance.”</p>

<p>Frederick returned to Berlin by a circuitous route, which occupied
ten days. His uncle, King George II. of England, whom
he exceedingly disliked, was then on a visit to his Hanoverian
possessions. Frederick passed within a few miles of his Britannic
majesty without deigning to call upon him. The slight
caused much comment in the English papers. It was regarded
as of national moment, for it implied that in the complicated
policy which then agitated the courts of Europe the sympathies
of Prussia would not be with England.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Frederick’s next younger brother, Augustus
William, who was heir-presumptive to the throne in default of
a son by Frederick, was betrothed to Louisa Amelia of Brunswick,
younger sister of Frederick’s bride.</p>

<p>About the middle of October Wilhelmina came to Berlin to
see her brothers again. Nine years had passed since her marriage,
and seven since her last sad visit to the home of her childhood,
in which inauspicious visit the wretchedness of her early
years had been renewed by the cruelty of her reception. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
Wilhelmina’s journal we find the following allusion to this her
second return to Berlin:</p>

<p>“We arrived at Berlin the end of October. My younger brothers,
followed by the princes of the blood and by all the court,
received us at the bottom of the stairs. I was led to my apartment,
where I found the reigning queen, my sisters, and the princesses.
I learned, with much chagrin, that the king was ill of
tertian ague. He sent me word that, being in his fit, he could
not see me, but that he depended on having that pleasure to-morrow.
The queen-mother, to whom I went without delay,
was in a dark condition. Her rooms were all hung in their lugubrious
drapery. Every thing was as yet in the depth of
mourning for my father. What a scene for me! Nature has
her rights. I can say with truth I have almost never in my life
been so moved as on this occasion. My interview with my
mother was very touching.”</p>

<p>The next morning Frederick hastened to greet his sister. Wilhelmina
was not pleased with his appearance. The cares of his
new reign entirely engrossed his mind. The dignity of an absolute
king did not sit gracefully upon him. Though ostentatiously
demonstrative in his greeting, the delicate instincts of
Wilhelmina taught her that her brother’s caresses were heartless.
He was just recovering from a fit of the ague, and looked
emaciate and sallow. The court was in mourning. During
those funereal days no festivities could be indulged in. The
queen-mother was decorously melancholy; she seems to have
been not only disappointed, but excessively chagrined, to find
that she was excluded by her son from the slightest influence in
public affairs. The distant, arrogant, and assuming airs of the
young king soon rendered him unpopular.</p>

<p>“A general discontent,” writes Wilhelmina, “reigned in the
country. The love of his subjects was pretty much gone. People
spoke of him in no measured terms. Some accused him of
caring nothing about those who helped him as Prince Royal.
Others complained of his avarice as surpassing that of the late
king. He was accused of violence of temper, of a suspicious disposition,
of distrust, haughtiness, dissimulation. I would have
spoken to him about these had not my brother Augustus William
and the queen regnant dissuaded me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
Frederick invited his sister to visit him at Reinsberg, to which
place either business or pleasure immediately called him. After
the lapse of two days, Wilhelmina, with the neglected Queen
Elizabeth, repaired to the enchanting chateau, hoping to find,
amid its rural scenes, that enjoyment which she never yet had
been able to find in the sombre halls of the Berlin palace. Here
quite a gay company was assembled. Frederick was very laboriously
occupied during the day in affairs of state. But in the
evening he appeared in the social circles, attracting the attention
of all by his conversational brilliance, and by the apparent heartiness
with which he entered into the amusements of the court.
He took an active part in some private theatricals, and none
were aware of the profound schemes of ambition which, cloaked
by this external gayety, were engrossing his thoughts.</p>

<p>On the 25th of October a courier arrived, direct from Vienna,
with the startling intelligence that the Emperor Charles VI. had
died five days before. The king was at the time suffering from
a severe attack of chills and fever. There was quite a long deliberation
in the court whether it were safe to communicate the
agitating intelligence to his majesty while he was so sick. They
delayed for an hour, and then cautiously informed the king of
the great event. Frederick listened in silence; uttered not a
word; made no sign.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> Subsequent events proved that his soul
must have been agitated by the tidings to its profoundest depths.
The death of the emperor, at that time, was unexpected. But it
is pretty evident that Frederick had, in the sombre recesses of
his mind, resolved upon a course of action when the emperor
should die which he knew would be fraught with the most momentous
results. In fact, this action proved the occasion of wars
and woes from which, could the king have foreseen them, he
would doubtless have shrunk back appalled.</p>

<p>The Emperor Charles VI. left no son. He therefore promulgated
a new law of succession in a decree known throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Europe as the “Pragmatic Sanction.” By the custom of the
realm the sceptre could descend only to male heirs. But by this
decree the king declared that the crown of the house of Hapsburg
should be transmitted to his daughter, Maria Theresa.
This law had been ratified by the estates of all the kingdoms
and principalities which composed the Austrian monarchy. All
the leading powers of Europe—England, France, Spain, <em>Prussia</em>,
Russia, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, and the Germanic body—had
bound themselves by treaty to maintain the “Pragmatic Sanction.”
It was a peaceable and wise arrangement, acceptable to
the people of Austria and to the dynasties of Europe as a means
of averting a war of succession, which might involve all the nations
of the Continent in the conflict.</p>

<p>The death-scene of the emperor was an event which must interest
every reader. Upon his return from a hunting excursion
into Hungary, he was attacked, on Thursday evening, October
16th, by slight indisposition, which was supposed to have been
caused by eating imprudently of mushrooms. His sickness, baffling
the skill of the doctors, increased, and by Saturday night
became alarming. On Tuesday it was thought that he was dying.
The pope’s nuncio administered to him the sacrament of
the Lord’s Supper. His majesty manifested great composure in
view of the sublime change before him, and said to one who was
weeping at his bedside,</p>

<p>“I am not afraid in contemplating the dread tribunal before
which I must now so soon appear. I am certain of my cause.
Look at me! A man that is certain of his cause can enter on
such a journey with good courage and a composed mind.”</p>

<p>To his physicians, who were doubtful respecting the nature
of his disease, he said, “If Doctor Gazelli were here you would
soon know what is my complaint. As it is, you will only learn
after you have dissected me.”</p>

<p>He then requested to be shown the cup in which his heart
would be placed after that operation. His daughter, Maria
Theresa, who had married the Grand-duke Francis, was in a
delicate state of health. The death of her father would place
the weighty crown upon her youthful brow. Grief and agitation
threw her helpless upon her bed. So important was her
life to the world that the emperor was unwilling that, in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
then condition, she should enter the death-chamber. “Tell my
Theresa,” said he, in faint and dying accents, “that I bless her,
notwithstanding her absence.”</p>

<p>The empress had fainted away at the bedside, and had been
borne, in the arms of the attendants, into her daughter Maria
Theresa’s chamber. She was now summoned, with the younger
children, for the final adieu. As the empress, almost delirious
with grief, re-entered the apartment, she threw herself upon the
bed of her dying husband, and exclaimed, in frenzied tones, “Do
not leave me! Do not leave me!”</p>

<p>During all the day of Wednesday weeping friends stood
around the bed, as the lamp of life flickered in its socket. Every
moment it was expected that the emperor would breathe his
last. At two o’clock the next morning the spirit took its flight,
and the lifeless clay alone remained. The grief-stricken empress
closed the eyes of her departed husband, kissed his hands, and
“was carried out more dead than alive.” Thus ended the male
line of the house of Hapsburg, after five centuries of royal sway.
The emperor died on the 20th of October 1740, in the fifty-sixth
year of his age.</p>

<p>As Frederick received the tidings of this death, he rose, dressed
himself, and his ague disappeared, to return no more. A
courier was immediately dispatched, at the top of his speed, to
summon to his presence General Schwerin and M. Podewils, his
chief minister. Two days must elapse before they could reach
him. In the mean time, the king, taking counsel of no one, was
maturing his plans, and making quiet but vigorous preparations
for their execution. He wrote the next day to Voltaire, in allusion
to the emperor’s death,</p>

<p>“I believe that there will, by June next, be more talk of cannon,
soldiers, trenches, than of actresses and dancers for the ballet.
This small event changes the entire system of Europe. It
is the little stone which Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream, loosening
itself and rolling down on the image made of four metals,
which it shivers to ruin.”</p>

<p>On the southeast frontier of Prussia, between that kingdom,
and Poland, and Hungary, there was an Austrian realm called
Silesia. The country embraced a territory of twenty thousand
square miles, being about twice as large as the State of Vermont.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
The population was about two millions. For more than a century
Silesia had been a portion of the Austrian kingdom. Time,
and the assent of Europe, had sanctioned the title.</p>

    <div class="caption">THE DEATH-SCENE OF THE EMPEROR.</div></div>

<p>But the young King Frederick was very ambitious of enlarging
the borders of his Liliputian realm, and of thus attaining a
higher position among the proud and powerful monarchs who
surrounded him. Maria Theresa, who had inherited the crown
of Austria, was a remarkably beautiful, graceful, and accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
young lady, in the twenty-fourth year of her age. She was
a young wife, having married Francis, Duke of Lorraine. Her
health, as we have mentioned, was at that time delicate. Frederick
thought the opportunity a favorable one for wresting Silesia
from Austria, and annexing it to his own kingdom. The
queen was entirely inexperienced, and could not prove a very
formidable military antagonist. Her army was in no respect,
either in number, discipline, or <em>materiel</em>, prepared for war. Her
treasury was deplorably empty. There was also reason for
Frederick to hope that several claimants would rise in opposition
to her, disputing the succession.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Frederick himself was in the very prime
of manhood. He was ambitious of military renown. He had
a compact army of one hundred thousand men, in better drill
and more amply provided with all the apparatus of war than
any other troops in Europe. The frugality of his father had
left him with a treasury full to overflowing. To take military
possession of Silesia would be a very easy thing. There was
nothing to obstruct the rush of his troops across the frontiers.
There were no strongly garrisoned fortresses, and not above
three thousand soldiers in the whole realm. No one even suspected
that Frederick would lay any claim to the territory, or
that there was the slightest danger of invasion. The complicated
claim which he finally presented, in official manifestoes,
was founded upon transactions which had taken place a hundred
years before. In conversation with his friends he did not
lay much stress upon any legitimate title he had to the territory.
He frankly admitted, to quote his own words, that “ambition,
interest, the desire of making people talk about me, carried
the day, and I decided for war.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>The general voice of history has severely condemned the
Prussian king for this invasion of Silesia. Frederick probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
owed his life to the interposition of the father of Maria Theresa,
when the young prince was threatened with the scaffold by his
own father. Prussia was bound by the most solemn guarantees
to respect the integrity of the Austrian states. There was seemingly
a great want of magnanimity in taking advantage of the
extreme youth, inexperience, and delicate health of the young
queen, who was also embarrassed by an empty treasury and a
weakened and undisciplined army. Frederick had also made,
in his <cite>Anti-Machiavel</cite>, loud protestations of his love of justice
and magnanimity. Mr. Carlyle, while honestly stating these
facts, still does not blame Frederick for seizing the opportunity
which the death of the emperor presented for him to enlarge his
dominions by plundering the domain of Maria Theresa.</p>

<div id="ip_217" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img src="images/i_217.jpg" width="800" height="568" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">MAP OF SILESIA.</div></div>

<p>“It is almost touching,” Mr. Carlyle writes, “to reflect how
unexpectedly, like a bolt out of the blue, all this had come upon
Frederick, and how it overset his fine programme for the winter
at Reinsberg, and for his life generally. Not the Peaceable
magnanimities, but the Warlike, are the thing appointed Frederick
this winter, and mainly henceforth. Those ‘golden or soft
radiances’ which we saw in him, admirable to Voltaire and to
Frederick, and to an esurient philanthropic world, it is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
those, it is the ‘steel bright or stellar kind’ that are to become
predominant in Frederick’s existence; grim hail-storms, thunders,
and tornado for an existence to him instead of the opulent genialities
and halcyon weather anticipated by himself and others.</p>

<p>“Indisputably enough to us, if not yet to Frederick, ‘Reinsberg
and Life to the Muses’ are done. On a sudden, from the
opposite side of the horizon, see miraculous Opportunity rushing
hitherward; swift, terrible, clothed with lightning like a courser
of the gods; dare you clutch <em>him</em> by the thunder-mane, and fling
yourself upon him, and make for the Empyrean by that course
rather? Be immediate about it, then; the time is now or never!
No fair judge can blame the young man that he laid hold of the
flaming Opportunity in this manner, and obeyed the new omen.
To seize such an Opportunity and perilously mount upon it was
the part of a young, magnanimous king, less sensible to the perils
and more to the other considerations than one older would
have been.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">With</span> the utmost secrecy Frederick matured his plans. It
could not be concealed that he was about to embark in some
important military enterprise. The embassadors from other
courts exerted all their ingenuity, but in vain, to ascertain in
what direction the army was to march. Though the French had
an embassador at Berlin, still it would seem that Voltaire was
sent as a spy, under the guise of friendship, to attempt to ferret
out the designs of the king. These men, who did not profess
any regard to the principles of religion, seem also to have trampled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
under feet all the instincts of honor. Voltaire endeavored
to conceal his treachery beneath smiles and flattery, writing even
love verses to the king. The king kept his own secret. Voltaire
was not a little chagrined by his want of success. In his
billet of leave he wrote:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Non, malgré vos vertus, non malgré vos appas,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Mon âme n’est point satisfaite:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Non, vous n’êtes qu’une coquette,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Qui subjuguez les cœurs, et ne vous donnez pas.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Frederick, while equally complimentary, while lavishing gifts
and smiles upon his guest, to whom he had written that as there
“could be but one God, so there could be but one Voltaire,”
wrote from Ruppin to M. Jordan, on the 28th of November, just
before Voltaire took his leave.</p>

<p>“Thy miser” (Voltaire) “shall drink to the lees of his insatiable
desire to enrich himself. He shall have the three thousand
thalers [$2250]. He was with me six days. That will
be at the rate of five hundred thalers [$375] a day. That is
paying dearly for a fool. Never had court fool such wages before.”</p>

<p>The Austrian envoy expressed to his court a suspicion that
Silesia might be threatened. The reply which came back was
that the Austrian court would not, and could not, believe that
a prince who was under such obligations to the father of Maria
Theresa, and who had made such loud professions of integrity
and philanthropy, could be guilty of such an outrage.</p>

<p>Frederick did what he could to divert the attention of the
court at Reinsberg by multiplying gayeties of every kind. There
was feasting, and music, and dancing, and theatric exhibitions,
often continuing until four o’clock in the morning. In the mean
time couriers were coming and going. Troops were moving.
Provisions and the <em>materiel</em> of war were accumulating. Anxious
embassadors watched every movement of the king’s hand,
weighed every word which escaped his lips, and tried every
adroit measure to elicit from him his secret. The Danish minister,
Prätorius, wrote to his court from Berlin:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
“From all persons who return from Reinsberg the unanimous
report is that the king works the whole day through with an
assiduity which is unique, and then, in the evening, gives himself
to the pleasures of society with a vivacity of mirth and
sprightly humor, which makes those evening parties charming.”</p>

<p>The Marquis of Botta, the Austrian envoy, endeavoring to penetrate
the plans of Frederick, descanted upon the horrible condition
of the roads in Silesia, which province he had traversed
in coming to Berlin. The king listened with a quiet smile, and
then, with much apparent indifference, replied,</p>

<p>“The worst which can happen to those who wish to travel in
Silesia is to get spattered with the mud.”</p>

<p>The English envoy, Sir Guy Dickens, being utterly baffled in
all his endeavors to discover the enterprise upon which the king
was about to embark, wrote to his court:</p>

<p>“Nobody here, great or small, dares make any representation
to this young prince against the measures he is pursuing, though
all are sensible of the confusion which must follow. A prince
who had the least regard to honor, truth, and justice, could not
act the part he is going to do. But it is plain his only view is
to deceive us all, and conceal for a while his ambitious and mischievous
designs.”</p>

<p>Dickens at length ventured to ask the king directly, “What
shall I write to England?”</p>

<p>Frederick angrily replied, “You can have no instructions to
ask that question. And if you had, I have an answer ready for
you. England has no right to inquire into my designs. Your
great sea armaments, did I ask you any question about them?
No! I was, and am, silent on that head.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
By the 10th of December, within a fortnight of the time that
the king received the tidings of the death of the emperor, he had
collected such a force on the frontiers of Silesia that there could
be no question that the invasion of that province was intended.
As not the slightest preparation had been made on the part of
Austria to meet such an event, the king could with perfect ease
overrun the province and seize all its fortresses. But Austria
was, in territory, resources, and military power, vastly stronger
than Prussia. It was therefore scarcely possible that Frederick
could hold the province, after he had seized it, unless he could
encourage others to dispute the succession of Maria Theresa, and
thus involve Europe in a general war. Frederick, having made
all his arrangements for prompt and vigorous action, sent to
Maria Theresa a message which could be regarded only as an
insult:</p>

<p>“Surrender to me peaceably,” was the substance of this demand,
“the province of Silesia, and I will be the ally of your majesty
in maintaining your right to the throne, and in defending
the integrity of all the rest of your realms. I will exert my influence
to have the Grand-duke Francis<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> chosen Emperor of
Germany, and will also immediately pay one million of dollars
into the Austrian treasury.”</p>

<p>An embassador, Count De Gotter, was sent to Vienna to present
this demand to Maria Theresa. He was authorized, in case
these terms were not accepted, to declare war. But in the mean
time, <em>before the count could possibly reach Vienna</em>, consequently
before there was any declaration of war, or even any demand
presented, Frederick, at the head of his troops, had entered Silesia,
and was seizing its defenseless fortresses.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>As the king was about to embark upon this enterprise, it was
proposed to place upon the banners the words “For God and our
Country.” But Frederick struck out the words “For God,” saying
that it was improper to introduce the name of the Deity into
the quarrels of men, and that he was embarking in war to gain
a province, not for religion.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> In a brief speech to his soldiers
he said,</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I do not look upon you as my subjects, but as
my friends. The troops of Brandenburg have always signalized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
themselves by their courage, and given, on different occasions,
the fullest evidences of their bravery. I shall be an eye-witness
to all your exploits. You will always fight in my presence. I
will recompense those who shall distinguish themselves for their
zeal in my service rather as a father than as a sovereign.”</p>

<p>In reference to this campaign the king subsequently wrote:
“At the death of the emperor there were but two Austrian regiments
in Silesia. Being determined to assert my right to that
duchy, I was obliged to make war during the winter, that I might
make the banks of the Neisse the scene of action. Had I waited
till the spring, what we gained by one single march would certainly
have cost us three or four difficult campaigns.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>To the summons which Frederick sent to Maria Theresa, demanding
the surrender of Silesia, no response could be returned,
consistent with the dignity of the crown, but a peremptory refusal.
The reply was unanswerable in its logic. Though it
was, in general, couched in courteous terms, one sentence crept
into it of rather scornful defiance.</p>

<p>“It seems strange,” said the Austrian minister of war, “that
his Prussian majesty, whose official post in Germany, as chamberlain
of the emperor, is to present the basin and towel to the
house of Austria, should now presume to prescribe rules to it.”</p>

<p>On Tuesday night, the 12th of December, 1740, there was a
very splendid masked ball in Berlin. The king and queen were
both present. The mind of the king was evidently preoccupied,
though he endeavored to assume an air of gayety. Privately
quitting the ball at a late hour, he set out, early in the morning,
to place himself at the head of forty thousand troops whom he
had assembled near the Silesian frontier. A small escort only
accompanied him. It was a cold winter’s day. Driving rapidly,
they reached Frankfort that night, sixty miles distant. In
the dawn of the next day the king was again upon the road,
and, after a drive of forty miles, reached Crossen, a border town,
where he established his head-quarters.</p>

<p>Two Silesian barons called upon him, and presented a protest
from the authorities they represented against his meditated invasion,
the design of which was now manifest to all. The king
received them very courteously, tossed the protest to a secretary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
to file away or to cast into the waste-paper basket, and invited
the two gentlemen to dine with him.</p>

<p>The next day the Prussian army, in two divisions, occupying
a space about ten miles long and ten broad in the lines of march,
crossed the frontiers, and entered the Silesian territory.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> Frederick
issued a proclamation declaring that he had come as a
friend; that no one would be molested in person, property, or
religious privileges; and that every thing used by the army
would be amply paid for.</p>

<p>In very rapid march, the troops advanced through Grünberg
toward Glogau, about forty miles in the interior. Here there
was a fortified town, which was considered the key of Northern
Silesia. It was but feebly garrisoned, and was entirely unprepared
for resistance. By great exertions, the Austrian governor
of the province, Count Wallis, and his second in command, General
Browne, succeeded in placing behind the works a little garrison
of one thousand men. The whole population was summoned
to work upon the ramparts. Count Wallis remained in
Glogau. General Browne took command of the troops and garrisons
abroad. But there was a division of sentiment within
the walls. Quite a large portion of the population was Protestant,
and would be glad to come under the protection of Protestant
Prussia. The Catholics were zealous for the continued reign
of Austria.</p>

<p>The Prussian troops, meeting with no opposition, spread over
the country, and a strong division reached Weichau on Saturday,
the 17th. There they spent Sunday in rest. Frederick was
anxious to win to his cause the Protestant population. He consequently
favored their religious institutions, and ordered that
Protestant worship should be held in the villages which he occupied,
and where there was no Protestant church edifice, one
part of the day in the Catholic churches. This plan he continued
through the campaign, much to the gratification of the chaplains
of his regiments and the Protestant community in Silesia.
Though the Austrian government had not been particularly oppressive
to the Protestants, still it leaned decidedly against what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
it deemed heresy. The Jesuits, favored by the governmental officials,
were unwearied in their endeavors to promote the interests
of their Church. Frederick, by allowing the impression to
be spread abroad that he was the champion of Protestantism,
was enabled to secure the sympathies of quite a strong party in
Silesia in his favor. It is said that two thirds of the inhabitants
of Silesia were Protestants, and therefore favorable to Frederick.</p>

    <div class="caption">THE MARCH INTO SILESIA.</div></div>

<p>In the suburbs of Glogau there was a Protestant church which
Count Wallis deemed it a military necessity to order to be burned
down, lest it should protect the Prussians in their attack.
“The Prussians,” said Wallis, “will make a block-house of it.”
The Protestants pleaded earnestly for a brief respite, and sent a
delegation to Frederick to intercede for the safety of their church.
The king very courteously, and with shrewd policy, replied,</p>

<p>“You are the first who have asked any favor of me on Silesian
ground. Your request shall be granted.”</p>

<p>Immediately he sent a polite note to Count Wallis, assuring
him that the attack, if attack were necessary, should be made on
the other side of the city, so that no military advantage could
be taken of the church. This popular act resounded widely not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
only through the Protestant community of Silesia, but throughout
Europe.</p>

<p>Monday morning, December 19th, the army was again on the
move, now spread out into a length of nearly fifteen miles, and
even more than that in breadth. Concentration was unnecessary,
as there was no foe to be encountered. The occupation of
this wide area enabled Frederick to take advantage of good
roads, and also to obtain abundance of supplies. Their advance
led them in a southerly direction, up the western banks of the
Oder, which stream here runs nearly north.</p>

<p>It seems to be ever the doom of an army to encounter mud
and rain. It was cold, gloomy, December weather. The troops
were drenched and chilled by the floods continually falling from
the clouds. The advance of the army was over a flat country
where the water stood in pools. All day long, Monday and
Tuesday, the rain continued to fall without intermission. But
the Prussian army, under its impetuous leader, paid no regard to
the antagonistic elements.</p>

<p>“Waters all out, bridges down,” writes Carlyle; “the country
one wide lake of eddying mud; up to the knee for many miles
together; up to the middle for long spaces; sometimes even to
the chin or deeper, where your bridge was washed away. The
Prussians marched through it as if they had been slate or iron.
Rank and file—nobody quitted his rank, nobody looked sour in
the face—they took the pouring of the skies and the red seas of
terrestrial liquid as matters that must be; cheered one another
with jocosities, with choral snatches, and swashed unweariedly
forward. Ten hours some of them were out, their march being
twenty or twenty-five miles.”</p>

<p>They reached Milkau Tuesday night, the 20th. Here they
were allowed one day of rest, and Frederick gave each soldier a
gratuity of about fifteen cents. On Thursday the march was resumed,
and the advance-guard of the army was rapidly gathered
around Glogau, behind whose walls Count Wallis had posted
his intrepid little garrison of a thousand men. Here Frederick
encountered his first opposition. The works were found too
strong to be carried by immediate assault, and Frederick had
not yet brought forward his siege cannon. The following extracts
from the correspondence which Frederick carried on at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
this time develop the state of public sentiment, and the views
and character of the king. His friend Jordan, who had been
left in Berlin, wrote to him as follows, under date of December
14, 1740, the day after the king left to place himself at the head
of his army:</p>

<p>“Every body here is on tiptoe for the event, of which both
origin and end are a riddle to most. Those who, in the style
of theologians, consider themselves entitled to be certain, maintain
that your majesty is expected with religious impatience by
the Protestants; and that the Catholics hope to see themselves
delivered from a multitude of imposts, which cruelly tear up the
beautiful bosom of their Church. You can not but succeed in
your valiant and stoical enterprise, since both religion and worldly
interest rank themselves under your flag. Wallis, they say,
has punished a Silesian heretic, of enthusiastic turn, as blasphemer,
for announcing that a new Messiah is just coming. I have a
taste for that kind of martyrdom. Critical persons consider the
present step as directly opposed to certain maxims in the <cite>Anti-Machiavel</cite>.”</p>

<p>Again M. Jordan wrote, a week later, on the 20th of December:</p>

<p>“The day before yesterday, in all churches, was prayer to
Heaven for success to your majesty’s arms, interest of the Protestant
religion being one cause of the war, or the only one assigned
by the reverend gentleman. At the sound of these words
the zeal of the people kindles. ‘Bless God for raising such a
defender! Who dared suspect our king’s indifference to Protestantism?’”</p>

<p>On the 19th of December the king wrote, from the vicinity of
Glogau, to M. Jordan. Perhaps he would not so frankly have
revealed his ambition and his want of principle had he supposed
that the private letter would be exposed to the perusal of the
whole civilized world.</p>

<p>“Seigneur Jordan,” the king writes, “thy letter has given me
a great deal of pleasure in regard to all these talkings thou reportest.
To-morrow I arrive at our last station this side of Glogau,
which place I hope to get in a few days. All things favor
my designs; and I hope to return to Berlin, after executing them,
gloriously, and in a way to be content with. Let the ignorant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
and the envious talk. It is not they who shall ever serve as
load-star to my designs; not they, but glory. With the love
of that I am penetrated more than ever. My troops have their
hearts big with it, and I answer to thee for success. Adieu!
dear Jordan. Write me all the ill the public says of thy friend,
and be persuaded that I love and will esteem thee always.”</p>

<p>To Voltaire the king wrote, in a very similar strain, four days
later, on the 23d of December:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Voltaire</span>,—I have received two of your letters,
but could not answer sooner. I am like Charles Twelfth’s chess
king, who was always on the move. For a fortnight past we
have been kept continually afoot and under way in such weather
as you never saw.</p>

<p>“I am too tired to reply to your delightful verses, and shivering
too much with cold to taste all the charm of them. But
that will come round again. Do not ask poetry from a man
who is actually doing the work of a wagoner, and sometimes
even of a wagoner stuck in the mud. Would you like to know
my way of life? We march from seven in the morning till four
in the afternoon. I dine then; afterward I work—I receive tiresome
visits; with these comes a detail of insipid matters of business.
’Tis wrong-headed men, punctiliously difficult, who are to
be set right; heads too hot which must be restrained, idle fellows
that must be urged, impatient men that must be rendered
docile, plunderers to be restrained within the bounds of equity,
babblers to hear babbling, dumb people to keep in talk; in fine,
one has to drink with those that like it, to eat with those who
are hungry; one has to become a Jew with Jews, a pagan with
pagans. Such are my occupations, which I would willingly
make over to another if the phantom they call glory did not rise
on me too often. In truth, it is a great folly, but a folly difficult
to cast away when once you are smitten by it.</p>

<p>“Adieu, my dear Voltaire! May Heaven preserve from misfortune
the man I should so like to sup with at night after fighting
in the morning. Do not forget the absent who love you.</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">Frederick.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>As we have mentioned, the army advanced mainly in two columns.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
While the left was briefly delayed at Glogau, the right,
under the command of General Schwerin, was pushed rapidly
forward a few leagues, to Liegnitz. They reached the city, unexpectedly
to its inhabitants, just at the dawn of a drear, chill
winter’s morning, the rain having changed to freezing cold. It
was Wednesday, December 28. The Prussian grenadiers stole
softly upon the slumbering sentinels, seized them, and locked
them in the guard-house. Then the whole column marched into
the heart of the city silently, without music, but with a tramp
which aroused all the sleepers in the streets through which they
passed—many of whom, in their night-caps, peered curiously out
of their chamber windows. Having reached the central square,
or market-place, the forces were concentrated, and the drums and
bugles pealed forth notes of triumph. The Prussian flag rose
promptly from rampart and tower. Liegnitz was essentially a
Protestant town. The inhabitants, who had received but few
favors from the Catholic Austrian government, welcomed their
invaders with cautious demonstrations of joy.</p>

<p>Frederick, having completed the investment of Glogau, cutting
off all its supplies, left a sufficient detachment there to starve the
city into submission. There were about seven thousand inhabitants
within the walls—“a much-enduring, frugal, pious, and
very desirable people.” As it was probable that the feeble garrison,
after a brief show of resistance, would surrender, Frederick
hastened in person, with all his remaining available troops, toward
Breslau, the capital of Silesia. On the 27th he wrote to
M. Jordan:</p>

<p>“I march to-morrow for Breslau, and shall be there in four
days. You Berliners have a spirit of prophecy which goes beyond
me. In fine, I go my road; and you will shortly see Silesia
ranked in the list of our provinces. Adieu! this is all I have
time to tell you. Religion and our brave soldiers will do the
rest.”</p>

<p>With almost unprecedented rapidity Frederick pressed his
troops along, accomplishing “in three marches near upon seventy
miles.” The course of the Oder here is, in its general direction,
northwest. The army marched along its southwestern banks.
On Saturday evening, the last day of the year, the advance-guard
took possession of the southern and western suburbs of Breslau.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
The city, of one hundred thousand inhabitants, was spread out
over both banks of the stream. Frederick established his headquarters
at the palace of Pilsnitz, about five miles from the city.
There were many Protestants in Breslau, who rejoiced in the
idea of exchanging a Catholic for a Protestant government. It
is said that some of the sentinels on the walls would watch their
opportunity and present arms to the Prussian soldiers, and even
at times exclaim, “Welcome, dear sirs!”</p>

<p>Before sunrise Sunday morning the Prussians had seized upon
many important posts. About seven o’clock a flag of truce, or
rather a trumpeter, approached one of the gates, demanding admittance
to communicate to the chief magistrate of the city the
intentions and requisitions of the Prussian king. After some
delay, two colonels were admitted. They demanded the entire
surrender of the city, and that the authority of Frederick, the
King of Prussia, should be recognized instead of that of Maria
Theresa, Queen of Austria. All their local laws and customs
were to be respected, and they were to be protected in all their
rights and privileges. Their own garrison should guard the
city. No Prussian soldier should enter the gates with other than
side-arms. The king himself, in taking possession of the city,
should be accompanied by a body-guard of but thirty men. The
city council was assembled to consider this summons, and thirty
hours were spent in anxious deliberation.</p>

<p>In the mean time Frederick took positions which commanded
the three gates on his, the southern, side of the river; constructed
a bridge of boats; and sent four hundred men across the
stream, and made preparations to force an entrance. At four
o’clock in the afternoon of Monday, not a gun having yet been
fired, a messenger brought the intelligence that the town would
be surrendered. At eight o’clock the next morning, Tuesday,
3d of January, 1741, the city authorities came in their coaches,
with much parade, to welcome their new sovereign. It was a
bitter cold morning. The king had ridden away to reconnoitre
the walls in their whole circuit. It was not until near noon that
he was prepared to accompany the officials to the palace which
was made ready for him. He then, on horseback, attended by
his principal officers, and followed by an imposing retinue, in a
grand entrance, proudly took possession of his easy conquest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
He rode a very magnificent gray charger, and wore his usual
cocked hat and a blue cloak, both of which were somewhat the
worse for wear. Four footmen, gorgeously dressed in scarlet,
trimmed with silver lace, walked by the side of his horse. The
streets through which he passed were thronged, and the windows
and balconies were crowded with spectators of both sexes.
Though Frederick did not meet with an enthusiastic reception,
he was very gracious, bowing to the people on each side of the
street, and saluting with much courtesy those who seemed to be
people of note.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 5th his Prussian majesty gave a grand
ball. All the nobility, high and low, were invited. The provident
king arranged that the expenses, which he was to defray,
should not exceed half a guinea for each guest. Early hours
were fashionable in those days. Frederick entered the assembly-rooms
at six o’clock, and opened the ball with a Silesian lady.
He was very complaisant, and walked through the rooms with a
smile upon his countenance, conversing freely with the most distinguished
of his guests. About ten o’clock he silently withdrew,
but the dancing and feasting continued until a late hour.</p>

<p>The king exerted all his powers of fascination to gain the affections
of the people. Though he dismissed all the Austrian
public functionaries, and supplied their places by his own friends,
he continued to the Catholics their ancient privileges, and paid
marked attention to the bishop and his clergy. At the same
time, he encouraged the Protestants with the expectation that
he would prove their especial friend. At the assemblies which
he gave each evening that he was in the city, he lavished his
smiles upon the ladies who were distinguished either for exalted
rank or for beauty. But there is no evidence that, during
this campaign, he wrote one line to his absent, neglected wife, or
that he expended one thought upon her.</p>

<p>About thirty miles southeast of Breslau is the pleasant little
town of Ohlau, situated in the delta formed by the junction of
the Ohlau River with the Oder. It was a place of some strength,
and the Austrian authorities had thrown into it a garrison of
three hundred men. Frederick appeared before its gates on the
morning of January the 9th. He immediately sent in the following
summons to the garrison:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
“If you make any resistance, you shall be treated as prisoners
of war. If you make no resistance, and promise not to serve
against us, you may march out of the city unmolested, with your
arms.”</p>

<p>The surrender was made. Fifteen miles nearly east from
Ohlau, on the southern banks of the Oder, is the little town of
Brieg. Frederick approached it with divisions of his army on
both sides of the river. The country was flat and densely wooded.
On the southern side, where Frederick marched with the
major part of his troops, it was traversed by an admirably paved
road. This was constructed one hundred and fifty-six years before
by one of the dukes of that realm. It was a broad highway,
paved with massive flat stones, climbing the mountains,
threading the valleys, traversing the plains—a road such as those
which the Romans constructed, and over which the legions of
the Cæsars tramped in their tireless conquests. This duke, in
consequence of his religious character, was called “George the
Pious.” His devotional spirit may be inferred from the following
inscription, in Latin, which he had engraved on a very massive
monument, constructed in commemoration of the achievement:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Others have made roads for us. We make them for posterity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Christ has opened for us all a road to heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>On the 11th, Brieg was summoned to surrender. The prompt
and resolute response was “<em>No</em>.” The place was found unexpectedly
strong, and a gallant little garrison of sixteen hundred
men had been assembled behind its walls. Frederick was much
annoyed by the delay thus occasioned. He promptly invested
the city so as to cut off all supplies, and dispatched an order to
Glogau to have the field artillery sent, as speedily as possible,
up the Oder to Brieg.</p>

<p>Two days before Frederick reached Brieg, a column of his
army, under General Schwerin, which had advanced by a line
parallel to the Oder, but several miles to the west, encountering
no opposition, reached Ottmachau, a considerable town with
a strong castle on the River Neisse. This was near the extreme
southern border of Silesia. The Austrian commander, General
Browne, had placed here also a garrison of sixteen hundred men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
with orders not to yield upon any terms, for that re-enforcements
should be speedily sent to them. A slight conflict ensued.
Twelve of the Prussians were killed. This was the first blood
which was shed. A delay of three days took place, when four
cannon were brought up, and the gates, both of the town and of
the castle, were blown open. The garrison offered to withdraw
upon the terms proposed in the summons to surrender. The
king was sent for to obtain his decision. He rebuked the garrison
sternly, and held all as prisoners of war. The officers were
sent to Cüstrin, the common soldiers to Berlin.</p>

<p>Preparations were now made for the capture of Neisse. This
was an opulent, attractive, well-fortified town of about seven
thousand inhabitants. It then occupied only the left or north
bank of the stream, which runs from the west to the east. The
region around, being highly cultivated, presented a beautiful aspect
of rich meadows, orchards, and vineyards. It was the chief
fortress of Southern Silesia, and, being very near the frontier of
Austria proper, was a position of great importance. Frederick,
having encountered so little opposition thus far, was highly
elated, expecting that Neisse would also immediately fall into
his hands. From Ottmachau he wrote, on the 14th of January,
to M. Jordan as follows:</p>

<p>“My dear Monsieur Jordan, my sweet Monsieur Jordan, my
quiet Monsieur Jordan, my good, my benign, my pacific, my most
humane Monsieur Jordan,—I announce to thy serenity the conquest
of Silesia. I warn thee of the bombardment of Neisse, and
I prepare thee for still more projects, and instruct thee of the
happiest successes that the womb of fortune ever bore.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>Three days after, on the 17th, the king wrote again to M. Jordan:</p>

<p>“I have the honor to inform your humanity that we are Christianly
preparing to bombard Neisse; and that, if the place will
not surrender of good-will, needs must that it be beaten to powder.
For the rest, our affairs go the best in the world; and soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
thou wilt hear nothing more of us, for in ten days it will all be
over, and I shall have the pleasure of seeing you and hearing
you in about a fortnight.</p>

<p>“I have seen neither my brother<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> nor Keyserling.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> I left
them at Breslau, not to expose them to the dangers of war. They
perhaps will be a little angry, but what can I do? the rather as,
on this occasion, one can not share in the glory unless one is a
mortar!</p>

<p>“Adieu; go and amuse yourself with Horace, study Pausanias,
and be gay over Anacreon. As to me, who for amusement have
nothing but merlons, fascines, and gabions, I pray God to grant
me soon a pleasanter and peacefuler occupation, and you health,
satisfaction, and whatever your heart desires.”</p>

<p>A letter of the same date as the above, addressed to Count
Algarotti,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> contains the following expressions:</p>

<p>“I have begun to settle the figure of Prussia. The outline
will be altogether regular; for the whole of Silesia is taken in
except one miserable hamlet, which perhaps I shall have to keep
blockaded until next spring. Up to this time the whole conquest
has cost me only twenty men and two officers.</p>

<p>“You are greatly wanting to me here. In all these three
hundred miles I have found no human creature comparable to
the Swan of Padua. I would willingly give ten cubic leagues
of ground for a genius similar to yours. But I perceive I was
about entreating you to return fast, and join me again, while you
are not yet arrived where your errand was. Make haste to arrive
then, to execute your commission, and fly back to me. I
wish you had a Fortunatus hat; it is the only thing defective
in your outfit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
“Adieu, dear Swan of Padua. Think, I pray, sometimes of
those who are getting themselves cut in slices for the sake of
glory here; and, above all, do not forget your friends who think
a thousand times of you.”</p>

<p>The River Neisse is quite narrow. In preparation for the
bombardment, Frederick planted his batteries on the south side
of the stream, and also approached the city from the north. It
will be remembered that Frederick had an army in Silesia at his
command of about forty thousand men, abundantly provided
with all the munitions of war. The little Austrian garrison
hurriedly thrown into Neisse consisted of but sixteen hundred
men, but poorly prepared either for battle or for siege. The
Austrian commandant, General Roth, determined upon a heroic
resistance. To deprive the assailants of shelter, the torch was
applied to all the beautiful suburbs. In a few hours the cruel
flames destroyed the labor of ages. Many once happy families
were impoverished and rendered homeless. Ashes, blackened
walls, and smouldering ruins took the place of gardens, villas,
and comfortable homes.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, January 15th, the deadly, concentric fire
of shot and shell was opened upon the crowded city, where
women and children, torn by war’s merciless missiles, ran to and
fro frantic with terror. The dreadful storm continued to rage,
with but few intermissions, until Wednesday. Still there were
no signs of surrender. The king, though his head-quarters were
a few miles distant, at Ottmachau, was almost constantly on the
ground superintending every thing. As he felt sure of the entire
conquest of Silesia, the whole province being now in his
possession except three small towns, he looked anxiously upon
the destruction which his own balls and bombs were effecting.
He was destroying his own property.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning General Borck was sent toward the
gates of the city, accompanied by a trumpeter, who, with bugle
blasts, was to summon General Roth to a parley. General Borck
was instructed to inform the Austrian commander that if he surrendered
immediately he should be treated with great leniency,
but that if he persisted in his defense the most terrible severity
should be his doom. To the people of Neisse it was a matter
of but very little moment whether they were under Austrian or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
Prussian domination. They would gladly accede to any terms
which would deliver them from the dreadful bombardment.
General Roth, therefore, would not allow what we should call
the flag of truce to approach the gates. He opened fire upon
General Borck so as not to wound him, but as a warning that
he must approach no nearer. The king was greatly angered by
this result.</p>

    <div class="caption">ATTACK UPON NEISSE.</div></div>

<p>In burning the suburbs, one of the mansions of the bishop, a
few miles from Neisse, had escaped the general conflagration.
The Prussians had taken possession of this large and commodious
structure, with its ample supply of winter fuel. General
Roth employed a resolute butcher, who, under the pretense of
supplying the Prussians with beef, visited the bishop’s mansion,
and secretly applied the torch. It was a cold winter’s night.
The high wind fanned the flames. Scarcely an hour passed ere
the whole structure, with all its supplies, was in ashes. The
Prussian officers who had found a warm home were driven into
the icy fields.</p>

<p>These two events so exasperated his Prussian majesty that
the next morning, at an early hour, he reopened upon the doomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
city with renewed vigor his fire of bombshells and red-hot
shot. Fire companies were organized throughout the city, to
rush with their engines wherever the glowing balls descended,
and thus the flames which frequently burst out were soon extinguished.
All day Thursday, Thursday night, Friday, and until
nine in the morning of Saturday, the tempest of battle, with occasional
lulls, hurled its bolts and uttered its thunders. There
was then a short rest until four o’clock on Sunday afternoon,
when the batteries again opened their action more vigorously
than ever, nine bombs being often in the air at the same time.</p>

<p>Frederick, not willing utterly to destroy the city, which he
wished to preserve for himself, and perhaps, though no word of
his indicates it, influenced by some sympathy for the seven thousand
unoffending inhabitants of the place, men, women, and children,
very many of whom were Protestants, who were suffering
far more from the missiles of war than the Austrian garrison, arrested
the fire of his batteries, and decided to convert the siege
into a blockade. His own troops were suffering much in the
bleak fields swept by the gales of winter. The whole of Silesia
was in his hands excepting the small towns of Brieg, Glogau, and
Neisse. These were so closely invested that neither food nor re-enforcements
could be introduced to them. Should they hold
out until spring, Frederick could easily then, aided by the warm
weather, break open their gates.</p>

<p>He therefore spread his troops abroad in winter quarters, levying
contributions upon the unhappy inhabitants of Silesia for
their support. The king, ever prompt in his movements, having
on Monday, the 23d of January, converted the siege into a blockade,
on Wednesday, the 25th, set out for home. Visiting one or
two important posts by the way, he reached Berlin the latter
part of the week. Here he was received with great acclamations
as a conquering hero. In six weeks he had overrun Silesia, and
had virtually annexed it to his own realms. Whether Austria
would quietly submit to this robbery, and whether Frederick
would be able to retain his conquest, were questions yet to be
decided.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">Frederick,</span> returning to Berlin from his six weeks’ campaign
in Silesia, remained at home but three weeks. He had recklessly
let loose the dogs of war, and must already have begun to be
appalled in view of the possible results. His embassadors at
the various courts had utterly failed to secure for him any alliance.
England and some of the other powers were manifestly
unfriendly to him. Like Frederick himself, they were all disposed
to consult merely their own individual interests. Thus
influenced, they looked calmly on to see how Frederick, who had
thrown into the face of the young Queen of Austria the gage of
battle, would meet the forces which she, with great energy, was
marshaling in defense of her realms. Frederick was manifestly
and outrageously in the wrong.</p>

<p>The chivalry of Europe was in sympathy with the young and
beautiful queen, who, inexperienced, afflicted by the death of her
father, and about to pass through the perils of maternity, had
been thus suddenly and rudely assailed by one who should have
protected her with almost a brother’s love and care. Every
court in Europe was familiar with the fact that the father of
Maria Theresa had not only humanely interceded, in the most
earnest terms, for the life of Frederick, but had interposed his imperial
authority’ to rescue him from the scaffold, with which he
was threatened by his unnatural parent. Frederick found that
he stood quite alone, and that he had nothing to depend upon
but his own energies and those of his compact, well-disciplined
army.</p>

<p>It would seem that Frederick was now disposed to compromise.
He authorized the suggestion to be made to the court at
Vienna by his minister, Count Gotter, that he was ready to withdraw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
from his enterprise, and to enter into alliance with Austria,
if the queen would surrender to him the duchy of Glogau
only, which was but a small part of Silesia. But to these terms
the heroic young queen would not listen. She justly regarded
them but as the proposition of the highway robber, who offers
to leave one his watch if he will peaceably surrender his purse.
Whatever regrets Frederick might have felt in view of the difficulties
in which he found himself involved, not the slightest indication
of them is to be seen in his correspondence. He had
passed the Rubicon. And now he summoned all his energies—such
energies as the world has seldom, if ever, witnessed before,
to carry out the enterprise upon which he had so recklessly entered,
and from which he could not without humiliation withdraw.</p>

<p>On the 19th of February, 1741, Frederick, having been at home
but three weeks, again left Berlin with re-enforcements, increasing
his army of invasion to sixty thousand men, to complete the
conquest of Silesia by the capture of the three fortresses which
still held out against him. On the 21st he reached Glogau.
After carefully reconnoitring the works, he left directions with
Prince Leopold of Dessau, who commanded the Prussian troops
there, to press the siege with all possible vigor. He was fearful
that Austrian troops might soon arrive to the relief of the place.</p>

<p>The king then hastened on to Schweidnitz, a few miles west
from Breslau. This was a small town, strongly fortified, about
equally distant from the three beleaguered fortresses—Neisse,
Brieg, and Glogau. The young monarch was daily becoming
more aware that he had embarked in an enterprise which threatened
him with fearful peril. He had not only failed to secure a
single ally, but there were indications that England and other
powers were in secret deliberation to join against him. He soon
learned that England had sent a gift or loan of a million of dollars—a
large sum in those days—to replenish the exhausted
treasury of Maria Theresa. His minister in Russia also transmitted
to him an appalling rumor that a project was in contemplation
by the King of England, the King of Poland, Anne, regent
of Russia, and Maria Theresa, to unite, and so partition the
Prussian kingdom as to render the ambitious Frederick powerless
to disturb the peace of Europe. The general motives which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
influenced the great monarchies in the stupendous war which
was soon evolved are sufficiently manifest. But these motives
led to a complication of intrigues which it would be alike tedious
and unprofitable to attempt to unravel.</p>

<p>Frederick wished to enlarge his Liliputian realms, and become
one of the powers of Europe. This he could only do by taking
advantage of the apparent momentary weakness of Austria, and
seizing a portion of the territory of the young queen. In order
to accomplish this, it was for his interest to oppose the election
of Maria Theresa’s husband, the Grand-duke Francis, as emperor.
The imperial crown placed upon the brow of Francis would invest
Austria with almost resistless power. Still, Frederick was
ready to promise his earnest concurrence in this arrangement if
Maria Theresa would surrender to him Silesia. He had even
moderated his terms, as we have mentioned, to a portion of the
province.</p>

<p>France had no fear of Prussia. Even with the addition of Silesia,
it would be comparatively a feeble realm. But France did
fear the supremacy of Austria over Europe. It was for the apparent
interest of the court of Versailles that Austria should be
weakened, and, consequently, that the husband of the queen
should not be chosen Emperor of Germany. Therefore France
was coming into sympathy with Frederick, and was disposed to
aid him in his warfare against Austria.</p>

<p>England was the hereditary foe of France. It was one of the
leading objects in her diplomacy to circumvent that power.
“Our great-grandfathers,” writes Carlyle, “lived in perpetual
terror that they would be devoured by France; that French ambition
would overset the Celestial Balance, and proceed next to
eat the British nation.” Strengthening Austria was weakening
France. Therefore the sympathies of England were strongly
with Austria. In addition to this, personal feelings came in.
The puerile little king, George II., hated implacably his nephew,
Frederick of Prussia, which hatred Frederick returned with interest.</p>

<p>Spain was at war with England, and was ready to enter into
an alliance with any power which would aid her in her struggle
with that formidable despot of the seas.</p>

<p>The Czarina, Anne of Russia, died the 28th of October, 1740,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
just eight days after the death of the emperor. She left, in the
cradle, the infant Czar Iwan, her nephew, two months old. The
father of this child was a brother of Frederick’s neglected wife
Elizabeth. The mother was the Russian Princess Catharine of
Mecklenburg, now called Princess Anne, whom Frederick had at
one time thought of applying for as his wife. Russia was a semi-barbaric
realm just emerging into consideration, and no one could
tell by what influences it would be swayed. The minor powers
could be controlled by the greater—constrained by terror or led
by bribes. Such, in general, was the state of Europe at this time.</p>

<p>Austria was rapidly marshaling her hosts, and pouring them
through the defiles of the mountains to regain Silesia. Her
troops still held three important fortresses—Neisse, Brieg, and
Glogau. These places were, however, closely blockaded by the
Prussians. Though it was midwinter, bands of Austrian horsemen
were soon sweeping in all directions, like local war tempests
borne on the wings of the wind. Wherever there was an unprotected
baggage-train, or a weakly-defended post, they came
swooping down to seize their prey, and vanished as suddenly as
they had appeared. Their numbers seemed to be continually increasing.
All the roads were swept by these swarms of irregulars,
who carefully avoided any serious engagement, while they
awaited the approach of the Austrian army, which was gathering
its strength to throw down to Frederick the gauntlet on an
open field of battle.</p>

<p>Much to Frederick’s chagrin, he soon learned that a body of
three hundred foot and three hundred horse, cautiously approaching
through by-paths in the mountains, had thrown itself into
Neisse, to strengthen the garrison there. This was on the 5th
of March. But six days before a still more alarming event had
occurred. On the 27th of February, Frederick, with a small escort,
not dreaming of danger, set out to visit two small posts in
the vicinity of Neisse. He stopped to dine with a few of his
officers in the little village of Wartha, while the principal part
of the detachment which accompanied him continued its movement
to Baumgarten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<div id="ip_241" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.9375em;">
  <img src="images/i_241.jpg" width="463" height="583" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">FREDERICK ON THE FIELD OF BAUMGARTEN.</div></div>

<p>The leader of an Austrian band of five hundred dragoons was
on the watch. As the detachment of one hundred and fifty
horse approached Baumgarten, the Austrians, from their ambuscade,
plunged upon them. There was a short, sharp conflict,
when the Prussians fled, leaving ten dead, sixteen prisoners, one
standard, and two kettle-drums in the hands of the victors. The
king had just sat down at the dinner-table, when he heard, at
the distance of a few miles, the tumult of the musketry. He
sprang from the table, hurriedly mustered a small force of forty
hussars and fifty foot, and hastened toward the scene. Arriving
at the field, he found it silent and deserted, and the ten men lying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
dead upon it. The victorious Austrians, disappointed in not
finding the king, bore their spoils in triumph to Vienna. It was
a very narrow escape for Frederick. Had he then been captured
it might have changed the history of Europe, and no one
can tell the amount of blood and woe which would have been
averted.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not strange that Frederick should have imbibed
a strong feeling of antipathy to Christianity. In his father’s life
he had witnessed only its most repulsive caricature. While making
the loudest protestations of piety, Frederick William, in his
daily conduct, had manifested mainly only every thing that is
hateful and of bad report. Still, it is quite evident that Frederick
was not blind to the distinction between the principles of
Christianity as taught by Jesus and developed in his life, and
the conduct of those who, professing his name, trampled those
principles beneath their feet. In one of his letters to Voltaire,
dated Cirey, August 26, 1736, Frederick wrote:</p>

<p>“May you never be disgusted with the sciences by the quarrels
of their cultivators; a race of men no better than courtiers;
often enough as greedy, intriguing, false, and cruel as these.</p>

<p>“And how sad for mankind that the very interpreters of Heaven’s
commandments—the theologians, I mean—are sometimes
the most dangerous of all! professed messengers of the Divinity,
yet men sometimes of obscure ideas and pernicious behavior,
their soul blown out with mere darkness, full of gall and pride
in proportion as it is empty of truths. Every thinking being
who is not of their opinion is an atheist; and every king who
does not favor them will be damned. Dangerous to the very
throne, and yet intrinsically insignificant.</p>

<p>“I respect metaphysical ideas. Rays of lightning they are in
the midst of deep night. More, I think, is not to be hoped from
metaphysics. It does not seem likely that the first principles
of things will ever be known. The mice that nestle in some little
holes of an immense building know not whether it is eternal,
or who the architect, or why he built it. Such mice are we.
And the divine architect has never, that I know of, told his secret
to one of us.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these sentiments, the king sent throughout
Silesia a supply of sixty Protestant preachers, ordained especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
for the work. Though Frederick himself did not wish to live
in accordance with the teachings of Jesus Christ, it is very evident
that he did not fear the influence of that Gospel upon his
Silesian subjects. Very wisely the Protestant preachers were
directed carefully to avoid giving any offense to the Catholics.
They were to preach in barns and town-halls in places where
there was no Protestant church. The salary of each was one
hundred and fifty dollars a year, probably with rations. They
were all placed under the general superintendence of one of the
army chaplains.</p>

<p>Every day it became more clear that Maria Theresa was resolved
not to part with one inch of her territory, and that the
Austrian court was thoroughly roused in its determination to
drive the intrusive Prussians out of Silesia. Though Frederick
had no scruples of conscience to prevent him from seizing a portion
of the domains of Maria Theresa, his astonishment and indignation
were alike aroused by the rumor that England, Poland,
and Russia were contemplating the dismemberment of his
realms. An army of thirty-six thousand men, under the old
Duke Leopold of Dessau,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> was immediately dispatched by Frederick
to Götten, on the frontiers of Hanover, to seize upon that
Continental possession of the King of England upon the slightest
indication of a hostile movement. George II. was greatly
alarmed by this menace.</p>

<p>Frederick found himself plunged into the midst of difficulties
and perils which exacted to the utmost his energies both of body
and of mind. Every moment was occupied in strengthening his
posts, collecting magazines, recruiting his forces, and planning to
circumvent the foe. From the calm of Reinsberg he found himself
suddenly tossed by the surges of one of the most terrible
tempests of conflict which a mortal ever encountered. Through
night and storm, almost without sleep and without food, drenched
and chilled, he was galloping over the hills and through the valleys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
climbing the steeples, fording the streams, wading the morasses,
involved in a struggle which now threatened even the
crown which he had so recently placed upon his brow. Had
Frederick alone suffered, but few tears of sympathy would have
been shed in his behalf; but his ambition had stirred up a conflict
which was soon to fill all Europe with the groans of the
dying, the tears of the widow, the wailings of the orphan.</p>

<p>Frederick deemed it of great importance to gain immediate
possession of Glogau. It was bravely defended by the Austrian
commander, Count Wallis, and there was hourly danger that an
Austrian army might appear for its relief. Frederick, in the intensity
of his anxiety, as he hurried from post to post, wrote
from every stopping-place to young Leopold, whom he had left
in command of the siege, urging him immediately to open the
trenches, concentrate the fire of his batteries, and to carry the
place by storm. “I have clear intelligence,” he wrote, “that
troops are actually on the way for the rescue of Glogau.” Each
note was more imperative than the succeeding one. On the 6th
of March he wrote from Ohlau:</p>

<p>“I am certainly informed that the enemy will make some attempt.
I hereby, with all distinctness, command that, so soon
as the petards are come, you attack Glogau. And you must
make your dispositions for more than one attack, so that if one
fail the other shall certainly succeed. I hope you will put off
no longer. Otherwise the blame of all the mischief that might
arise out of longer delay must lie on you alone.”</p>

<p>On the 8th of March Leopold summoned all his generals at
noon, and informed them that Glogau, at all hazards, must be
taken that very night. The most minute directions were given
to each one. There were to be three attacks—one up the river
on its left bank, one down the river on its right bank, and one on
the land side perpendicular to the other two. The moment the
clock on the big steeple in Glogau should give the first stroke of
midnight, the three columns were to start. Before the last stroke
should be given they were all to be upon the silent, rapid advance.</p>

<p>Count Wallis, who was intrusted with the defense of the place,
had a garrison of about a thousand men, with fifty-eight heavy
guns and several mortars, and a large amount of ammunition.
Glogau was in the latitude of fifty-two, nearly six degrees north<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
of Quebec. It was a cold wintry night. The ground was covered
with snow. Water had been thrown upon the glacis, so
that it was slippery with ice. Prince Leopold in person led one
of the columns. The sentinels upon the walls were not alarmed
until three impetuous columns, like concentrating tornadoes, were
sweeping down upon them. They shouted “To arms!” The
soldiers, roused from sleep, rushed to their guns. Their lightning
flashes were instantly followed by war’s deepest thunders,
as discharge followed discharge in rapid succession.</p>

<p>But the assailants were already so near the walls that the shot
passed harmlessly over their heads. Without firing a gun or uttering
a sound, these well-drilled soldiers of Frederick William
hewed down the palisades, tore out the chevaux-de-frise, and
clambered over the glacis. With axe and petard they burst
open the gates and surged into the city.</p>

<p>In one short hour the gallant deed was done. But ten of the
assailants were killed and forty-eight wounded. The loss of the
Austrians was more severe. The whole garrison, one thousand
sixty-five in number, and their <em>materiel</em> of war, consisting of fifty
brass cannons, a large amount of ammunition, and the military
chest, containing thirty-two thousand florins, fell into the hands
of the victors. To the inhabitants of Glogau it was a matter of
very little moment whether the Austrian or the Prussian banner
floated over their citadel. Neither party paid much more
regard to the rights of the people than they did to those of the
mules and the horses.</p>

<p>But to Frederick the importance of the achievement was very
great. The exploit was justly ascribed to his general direction.
Thus he obtained a taste of that military renown which he had
so greatly coveted. The king was, at this time, at his head-quarters
at Schweidnitz, about one hundred and twenty miles from
Glogau. A courier, dispatched immediately from the captured
town, communicated to him, at five o’clock in the afternoon, the
glad tidings of the brilliant victory.</p>

<p>Frederick was overjoyed. In the exuberance of his satisfaction,
he sent Prince Leopold a present of ten thousand dollars.
To each private soldier he gave half a guinea, and to the officers
sums in proportion. To the old Duke of Dessauer, father of the
young Prince Leopold, he wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<div id="ip_246" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 29em;">
  <img src="images/i_246.jpg" width="464" height="601" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">THE ASSAULT ON GLOGAU.</div></div>

<p>“The more I think of the Glogau business the more important
I find it. Prince Leopold has achieved the prettiest military
stroke that has been done in this century. From my heart I
congratulate you on having such a son. In boldness of resolution,
in plan, in execution, it is alike admirable, and quite gives
a turn to my affairs.”</p>

<p>Leaving a sufficient force to garrison Glogau, the king ordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
all the remaining regiments to be distributed among the other
important posts; while Prince Leopold, in high favor, joined the
king at Schweidnitz, to assist in the siege of Neisse. Frederick
rapidly concentrated his forces for the capture of Neisse before
the Austrian army should march for its relief. He thought that
the Austrians would not be able to take the field before the
snow should disappear and the new spring grass should come,
affording forage for their horses.</p>

    <div class="caption">MAP ILLUSTRATING THE MOLLWITZ CAMPAIGN.</div></div>

<p>But General Neipperg, the Austrian commander-in-chief,
proved as watchful, enterprising, and energetic as Frederick.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
His scouting bands swarmed in all directions. The Prussian
foraging parties were cut off, their reconnoitrers were driven
back, and all the movements of the main body of the Austrian
army were veiled from their view. General Neipperg, hearing
of the fall of Glogau, decided, notwithstanding the inclemency
of the weather and the snow, to march immediately, with thirty
thousand men, to the relief of Neisse. His path led through
mountain defiles, over whose steep and icy roads his heavy guns
and lumbering ammunition-wagons were with difficulty drawn.</p>

<p>At the same time, Frederick, unaware of the movement of the
Austrians, prepared to push the siege of Neisse with the utmost
vigor. Leaving some of his ablest generals to conduct the operations
there, Frederick himself marched, with strong re-enforcements,
to strengthen General Schwerin, who was stationed among
the Jagerndorf hills, on the southern frontier of Silesia, to prevent
the Austrians from getting across the mountains. Marching
from Ottmachau, the king met General Schwerin at Neustadt,
half way to Jagerndorf, and they returned together to that place.
But the swarming horsemen of General Neipperg were so bold
and watchful that no information could be obtained of the situation
or movements of the Austrian army. Frederick, seeing no
indications that General Neipperg was attempting to force his
way through the snow-encumbered defiles of the mountains, prepared
to return, and, with his concentrated force, press with all
vigor the siege of Neisse.</p>

<p>As he was upon the point of setting off, seven Austrian deserters
came in and reported that General Neipperg’s full army
was advancing at but a few miles’ distance. Even as they were
giving their report, sounds of musketry and cannon announced
that the Prussian outposts were assailed by the advance-guard
of the foe. The peril of Frederick was great. Had Neipperg
known the prize within his reach, the escape of the Prussian
king would have been almost impossible. Frederick had but
three or four thousand men with him at Jagerndorf, and only
three pieces of artillery, with forty rounds of ammunition. Bands
of Austrian cavalry on fleet horses were swarming all around
him. Seldom, in the whole course of his life, had Frederick
been placed in a more critical position.</p>

<p>It was soon ascertained that the main body of the Austrian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
army was fifteen miles to the southwest, at Freudenthal, pressing
on toward Neisse. General Neipperg, without the slightest suspicion
that Frederick was any where in his vicinity, had sent
aside a reconnoitring party of skirmishers to ascertain if there
were any Prussians at Jagerndorf. General Neipperg, at Freudenthal,
was as near Neisse as Frederick was at Jagerndorf.</p>

<p>There was not a moment to be lost. General Neipperg was
moving resolutely forward with a cloud of skirmishers in the
advance and on his wings. With the utmost exertions Frederick
immediately rendezvoused all his remote posts, destroying such
stores as could not hastily be removed, and by a forced march
of twenty-five miles in one day reached Neustadt. General Neipperg
was marching by a parallel road about twenty miles west
of that which the Prussians traversed. At Neustadt the king
was still twenty miles from Neisse. With the delay of but a
few hours, that he might assemble all the Prussian bands from
the posts in that neighborhood, the king again resumed his
march. He had no longer any hope of continuing the siege of
Neisse. His only aim was to concentrate all his scattered forces,
which had been spread over an area of nearly two thousand
square miles, and, upon some well-selected field, to trust to the
uncertain issues of a general battle. There was no choice left
for him between this course and an ignominious retreat.</p>

<p>Therefore, instead of marching upon Neisse, the king directed
his course to Steinau, twenty miles east of Neisse. The siege
was abandoned, and the whole Prussian army, so far as was possible,
was gathered around the king. On the 5th of April Frederick
established his head-quarters at Steinau. On that same
day, General Neipperg, with the advanced corps of his army, triumphantly
entered Neisse. Apprehensive of an immediate attack,
Frederick made all his arrangements for a battle. In the
confusion of those hours, during which the whole Prussian army,
with all its vast accumulation of artillery and baggage-wagons,
was surging like an inundation through the streets of Steinau,
the village took fire and was burned to ashes. With great difficulty
the artillery and powder were saved, being entangled in
the narrow streets while the adjoining houses were enveloped in
flames. The night was intensely cold. The Prussian army bivouacked
in the open frozen fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
General Neipperg, as his men were weary with their long
march, did not make an attack, but allowed his troops a short
season of repose in the enjoyment of the comforts of Neisse. The
next morning, the 6th, Frederick continued his retreat to Friedland,
ten miles farther north. He was anxious to get between
the Austrians and Ohlau. He had many pieces of artillery there,
and large stores of ammunition, which would prove a rich prize
to the Austrians. It was Frederick’s intention to cross the River
Neisse at a bridge at Sorgau, eight miles from Friedland; but
the officer in charge there had been compelled to destroy the
bridge, to protect himself from the Austrian horsemen, who in
large numbers had appeared upon the opposite banks. Prince
Leopold was sent with the artillery and a strong force to reconstruct
the bridge and force the passage, but the Austrian dragoons
were encountered in such numbers that the enterprise was
found impossible.</p>

<p>Frederick therefore decided to march down the river twenty
miles farther, to Lowen, where there was a good bridge. To favor
the operation, Prince Leopold, with large divisions of the
army and much of the baggage, was to cross the Neisse on pontoons
at Michelau, a few miles above Lowen. Both passages
were successfully accomplished, and the two columns effected a
junction on the west side of the river on the 8th of April. The
blockade of Brieg was abandoned, and its blockading force
united with the general army.</p>

<p>General Neipperg had now left Neisse; but he kept himself
so surrounded by clouds of skirmishers as to render his march
entirely invisible. Frederick, anxious to unite with him his
troops under the Prince of Holstein Beck, advanced toward
Grottkau to meet that division, which had been ordered to join
him. The prince had been stationed at Frankenstein, with a
force of about eight thousand, horse and foot; but the Austrian
scouts so occupied all the roads that the king had not been able
to obtain any tidings from him whatever.</p>

<p>It was Saturday, the 8th of April. A blinding, smothering
storm of snow swept over the bleak plains. Breasting the gale,
and wading through the drifts, the Prussian troops tramped
along, unable to see scarcely a rod before them. At a little hamlet
called Leipe the vanguard encountered a band of Austrian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
hussars. They took several captives. From them they learned,
much to their chagrin and not a little to their alarm, that the
Austrian army was already in possession of Grottkau.</p>

    <div class="caption">THE NIGHT BEFORE MOLLWITZ.</div></div>

<p>Instantly the Prussian troops were ordered to the right about.
Rapidly retracing their steps through the streets of Leipe, much
to the surprise of its inhabitants, they pressed on seven miles
farther toward Ohlau, and encamped for the night. The anxiety
of Frederick in these hours when he was retiring before the foe,
and when there was every probability of his incurring disgrace
instead of gaining honor, must have been dreadful. There was
no sleep for him that night. The Prussians were almost surrounded
by the Austrians, and it was quite certain that the morrow
would usher in a battle. Oppressed by the peril of his position,
the king, during the night, wrote to his brother Augustus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
William, who was at Breslau, as follows. The letter was dated
at the little village of Pogerell, where the king had taken shelter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest Brother</span>,—The enemy has just got into Silesia.
We are not more than a mile from them. To-morrow must decide
our fortune. If I die, do not forget a brother who has always
loved you most tenderly. I recommend to you my most
dear mother, my domestics, and my first battalion. Eichel and
Schuhmacher are informed of all my testamentary wishes.</p>

<p>“Remember me always, but console yourself for my death.
The glory of the Prussian arms and the honor of the house have
set me in action, and will guide me to my last moment. You
are my sole heir. I recommend to you, in dying, those whom I
have the most loved during my life—Keyserling, Jordan, Wartensleben,
Hacke, who is a very honest man, Fredersdorf, and
Eichel, in whom you may place entire confidence.</p>

<p>“I bequeath eight thousand crowns ($6000) to my domestics.
All that I have elsewhere depends on you. To each of my brothers
and sisters make a present in my name; a thousand affectionate
regards to my sister at Baireuth. You know what I think
on their score; and you know, better than I can tell you, the tenderness
and all the sentiments of most inviolable friendship with
which I am, dearest brother, your faithful brother and servant
till death,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Frederick</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>To his friend Jordan, who was also in Breslau, he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Jordan</span>,—We are going to fight to-morrow. Thou
knowest the chances of war. The life of kings is not more regarded
than that of private people. I know not what will happen
to me.</p>

<p>“If my destiny is finished, remember a friend who loves thee
always tenderly. If Heaven prolong my days, I will write to
thee after to-morrow, and thou shalt hear of our victory. Adieu,
dear friend; I shall love thee till death.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Frederick.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is worthy of notice that there is no indication that the king
sent any word of affectionate remembrance to his neglected wife.
It is a remarkable feature in the character of the Emperor Napoleon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
I. that in his busiest campaigns rarely did a day pass in
which he did not write to Josephine. He often wrote to her
twice a day.</p>

<p>Sunday morning, the 9th, dawned luridly. The storm raged
unabated. The air was so filled with the falling snow that one
could not see the distance of twenty paces, and the gale was
piling up large drifts on the frozen plains. Neither army could
move. Neipperg was in advance of Frederick, and had established
his head-quarters at the village of Mollwitz, a few miles
northwest of Pogerell. He had therefore got fairly between the
Prussians and Ohlau. But Frederick knew not where the Austrian
army was. For six-and-thirty hours the wild storm drove
both Prussians and Austrians to such shelter as could be obtained
in the several hamlets which were scattered over the extended
plain.</p>

<p>Frederick dispatched messengers to Ohlau to summon the
force there to his aid; the messengers were all captured. The
Prussians were now in a deplorable condition. The roads were
encumbered and rendered almost impassable by the drifted snow.
The army was cut off from its supplies, and had provisions on
hand but for a single day. Both parties alike plundered the
poor inhabitants of their cattle, sheep, and grain. Every thing
that could burn was seized for their camp-fires. We speak of the
carnage of the battle-field, and often forget the misery which is
almost invariably brought upon the helpless inhabitants of the
region through which the armies move. The schoolmaster of
Mollwitz, a kind, simple-hearted, accurate old gentleman, wrote
an account of the scenes he witnessed. Under date of Mollwitz,
Sunday, April 9, he writes:</p>

<p>“Country, for two days back, was in new alarm by the Austrian
garrison of Brieg, now left at liberty, who sallied out upon
the villages about, and plundered black cattle, sheep, grain, and
whatever they could come at. But this day in Mollwitz the
whole Austrian army was upon us. First there went three hundred
hussars through the village to Grüningen, who quartered
themselves there, and rushed hither and thither into houses, robbing
and plundering. From one they took his best horses; from
another they took linen, clothes, and other furnitures and victual.</p>

<p>“General Neipperg halted here at Mollwitz with the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
army before the village, in mind to quarter. And quarter was
settled, so that a plow-farmer got four to five companies to lodge,
and a spade-farmer two or three hundred cavalry. The houses
were full of officers, and the fields full of horsemen and baggage;
and all around you saw nothing but fires burning. The wooden
railings were instantly torn down for firewood. The hay, straw,
barley were eaten away, and brought to nothing. Every thing
from the barns was carried out. As the whole army could not
lodge itself with us, eleven hundred infantry quartered at Laugwitz.
Bärzdorf got four hundred cavalry; and this day nobody
knew what would come of it.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DEFEAT AND FLIGHT OF FREDERICK.</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Preparing for the Battle.—The Surprise.—The Snow-encumbered Plain.—Horror of the Scene.—Flight
of Frederick.—His Shame and Despair.—Unexpected Victory of the Prussians.—Letters
of Frederick.—Adventures of Maupertuis.</p></blockquote>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">Monday</span> morning the storm ceased. There was a perfect calm.
For leagues the spotless snow, nearly two feet deep, covered all
the extended plains. The anxiety of Frederick had been so
great that for two nights he had not been able to get any sleep.
He had plunged into this war with the full assurance that he
was to gain victory and glory. It now seemed inevitable that
he was to encounter but defeat and shame.</p>

<p>At the earliest dawn the whole army was in motion. Ranked
in four columns, they cautiously advanced toward Ohlau,
ready to deploy instantly into line of battle should the enemy
appear. Scouts were sent out in all directions. But, toiling
painfully through the drifts, they could obtain no reliable information.
The spy-glass revealed nothing but the winding-sheet
of crisp and sparkling snow, with scarcely a shrub or a
tree to break the dreary view. There were no fences to be seen—nothing
but a smooth, white plain, spreading for miles around.
The hamlet of Mollwitz, where General Neipperg had established
his head-quarters, was about seven miles north from Pogerell,
from which point Frederick was marching. At the distance of
a few miles from each other there were several wretched little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
hamlets, consisting of a few low, thatched, clay farm-houses clustered
together.</p>

<p>General Neipperg was not attempting to move in the deep
snow. He, however, sent out a reconnoitring party of mounted
hussars under General Rothenburg. About two miles from
Mollwitz this party encountered the advance-guard of the Prussians.
The hussars, after a momentary conflict, in which several
fell, retreated and gave the alarm. General Neipperg was just
sitting down to dinner. The Prussian advance waited for the
rear columns to come up, and then deployed into line. As the
Austrian hussars dashed into the village of Mollwitz with the
announcement that the Prussians were on the march, had attacked
them, and killed forty of their number, General Neipperg
dropped knife and fork, sprang from the table, and dispatched
couriers in all directions, galloping for life, to concentrate his
troops. His force was mainly distributed about in three villages,
two or three miles apart. The clangor of trumpets and
drums resounded; and by the greatest exertions the Austrian
troops were collected from their scattered encampments, and
formed in two parallel lines, about two miles in length, facing
the Prussians, who were slowly advancing in the same order,
wading through the snow. Each army was formed with the infantry
in the centre and the cavalry on the wings. Frederick
was then but an inexperienced soldier. He subsequently condemned
the want of military ability which he displayed upon
this occasion.</p>

<p>“We approached,” he writes, “Marshal Neipperg’s army without
being discovered by any one man living. His troops were
then cantoned in three villages. But at that time I had not sufficient
experience to know how to avail myself of such an opportunity.
I ought immediately to have ordered two of my columns
to surround the village of Mollwitz, and then to have attacked
it. I ought at the same instant to have detached my
dragoons with orders to have attacked the other two villages,
which contained the Austrian cavalry. The infantry, which
should have followed, would have prevented them from mounting.
If I had proceeded in this way I am convinced that I
should have totally destroyed the Austrian army.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
It was now about noon. The sun shone brightly on the glistening
snow. There was no wind. Twenty thousand peasants,
armed and drilled as soldiers, were facing each other upon either
side, to engage in mutual slaughter, with no animosity between
them—no cause of quarrel. It is one of the unrevealed mysteries
of Providence that any one man should thus have it in his
power to create such wide-spread death and misery. The Austrians
had a splendid body of cavalry, eight thousand six hundred
in number. Frederick had but about half as many horsemen.
The Prussians had sixty pieces of artillery, the Austrians
but eighteen.</p>

<p>The battle soon began, with its tumult, its thunder-roar of artillery
and musketry, its gushing blood, its cries of agony, its
death convulsions. Both parties fought with the reckless courage,
the desperation with which trained soldiers, of whatever
nationality, almost always fight.</p>

<p>The Prussians advanced in their long double line, trampling
the deep snow beneath their feet. All their banners were waving.
All their bands of music were pealing forth their most
martial airs. Their sixty pieces of artillery, well in front, opened
a rapid and deadly fire. The thoroughly-drilled Prussian
artillerymen discharged their guns with unerring aim, breaking
gaps in the Austrian ranks, and with such wonderful rapidity
that the unintermitted roar of the cannons drowned the sound
of drums and trumpets.</p>

<p>The Austrian cavalry made an impetuous charge upon the
weaker Prussian cavalry on the right of the Prussian line. Frederick
commanded here in person. The Prussian right wing was
speedily routed, and driven in wild retreat over the plain. The
king lost his presence of mind and fled ingloriously with the fugitives.
General Schulenberg endeavored, in vain, to rally the
disordered masses. He received a sabre slash across his face.
Drenched in blood, he still struggled, unavailingly, to arrest the
torrent, when a bullet struck him dead. The battle was now
raging fiercely all along the lines.</p>

<p>General Römer, in command of the Austrian cavalry, had
crushed the right wing of the Prussians. Resolutely he followed
up his victory, hotly chasing the fugitives in the wildest disorder
far away to the rear, capturing nine of their guns. Who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
can imagine the scene? There were three or four thousand
horsemen put to utter rout, clattering over the plain, impetuously
pursued by six or seven thousand of the finest cavalry in the
world, discharging pistol-shots into their flying ranks, and raining
down upon them sabre-blows.</p>

<p>The young king, all unaccustomed to those horrors of war
which he had evoked, was swept along with the inundation.
The danger of his falling in the midst of the general carnage, or
of his capture, which was, perhaps, still more to be dreaded, was
imminent. His friends entreated him to escape for his life.
Even Marshal Schwerin, the veteran soldier, assured him that
the battle was lost, and that he probably could escape capture
only by a precipitate flight.</p>

<div id="ip_257" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.4375em;">
  <img src="images/i_257.jpg" width="455" height="456" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">FLIGHT OF FREDERICK.</div></div>

<p>Frederick, thus urged, leaving the main body of his army, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
he supposed, in utter rout, with a small escort, put spurs to his
steed in the attempt to escape. The king was well mounted on
a very splendid bay horse. A rapid ride of fifteen miles in a
southerly direction brought him to the River Neisse, which he
crossed by a bridge at the little town of Lowen. Immediately
after his departure Prince Leopold dispatched a squadron of
dragoons to accompany the king as his body-guard. But Frederick
fled so rapidly that they could not overtake him, and in
the darkness, for night soon approached, they lost his track.
Even several of the few who accompanied him, not so well
mounted as the king, dropped off by the way, their horses not
being able to keep up with his swift pace.</p>

<p>It was Frederick’s aim to reach Oppeln, a small town upon
the River Oder, about thirty miles from the field of battle. He
supposed that one of his regiments still held that place. But
this regiment had hurriedly vacated the post, and had repaired,
with all its baggage, to Pampitz, in the vicinity of Mollwitz.
Upon the retirement of this garrison a wandering party of sixty
Austrian hussars had taken possession of the town.</p>

<p>Frederick, unaware that Oppeln was in the hands of the enemy,
arrived, with the few of his suite who had been able to keep
up with him, about midnight before the closed gates of the town.
“Who are you?” the Austrian sentinels inquired. “We are
Prussians,” was the reply, “accompanying a courier from the
king.” The Austrians, unconscious of the prize within their
grasp, and not knowing how numerous the Prussian party might
be, instantly opened a musketry fire upon them through the iron
gratings of the gate. Had they but thrown open the gate and
thus let the king enter the trap, the whole history of Europe
might have been changed. Upon apparently such trivial chances
the destinies of empires and of the world depend. Fortunately,
in the darkness and the confusion, none were struck by the bullets.</p>

<p>At Oppeln there was a bridge across the Oder by which the
king hoped to escape with his regiment to the free country beyond.
There he intended to summon to his aid the army of
thirty-six thousand men which he had sent to Götten under the
“Old Dessauer.” The discharge of the musketry of the Austrians
blasted even this dismal hope. It seemed as though Frederick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
were doomed to drain the cup of misery to its dregs; and
his anguish must have been intensified by the consciousness that
he deserved it all. But a few leagues behind him, the bleak,
snow-clad plains, swept by the night-winds, were strewed with
the bodies of eight or nine thousand men, the dying and the
dead, innocent peasant-boys torn from their homes, whose butchery
had been caused by his own selfish ambition.</p>

<p>The king, in utter exhaustion from hunger, sleeplessness, anxiety,
and misery, for a moment lost all self-control. As with his
little band of fugitives he vanished into the gloom of the night,
not knowing where to go, he exclaimed, in the bitterness of his
despair, “O my God, my God, this is too much!”</p>

<p>Retracing his steps in the darkness some fifteen miles, he returned
to Lowen, where, by a bridge, a few hours before, he had
crossed the Neisse. Taught caution by the misadventure at Oppeln,
he reined up his horse, before the morning dawned, at the
mill of Hilbersdorf, about a mile and a half from the town. The
king, upon his high-blooded charger, had outridden nearly all
his escort; but one or two were now with him. One of these
attendants he sent into the town to ascertain if it were still held
by the Prussians. Almost alone, he waited under the shelter of
the mill the return of his courier. It was still night, dark and
cold. The wind, sweeping over the snow-clad plains, caused the
exhausted, half-famished monarch to shiver in his saddle.</p>

<p>There is a gloom of the soul far deeper than any gloom with
which nature can ever be shrouded. It is not easy to conceive
of a mortal placed in circumstances of greater mental suffering
than was the proud, ambitious young monarch during the hour
in which he waited, in terror and disgrace, by the side of the
mill, for the return of his courier. At length the clatter of hoofs
was heard, and the messenger came back, accompanied by an adjutant,
to announce to the king that the Prussians still held
Lowen, and that <em>the Prussian army had gained a signal victory
at Mollwitz</em>.</p>

<p>Who can imagine the conflicting emotions of joy and wretchedness,
of triumph and shame, of relief and chagrin, with which
the heart of Frederick must have been rent! The army of Prussia
had triumphed, under the leadership of his generals, while
he, its young and ambitious sovereign, who had unjustly provoked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
war that he might obtain military glory, a fugitive from
the field, was scampering like a coward over the plains at midnight,
seeking his own safety. Never, perhaps, was there a more
signal instance of a retributive providence. Frederick knew full
well that the derision of Europe would be excited by caricatures
and lampoons of the chivalric fugitive. Nor was he deceived in
his anticipations. There was no end to the ridicule which was
heaped upon Frederick, galloping, for dear life, from the battle-field
in one direction, while his solid columns were advancing to
victory in the other. His sarcastic foes were ungenerous and
unjust. But when do foes, wielding the weapons of ridicule,
ever pretend even to be just and generous?</p>

  <img src="images/i_260.jpg" width="353" height="464" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">FREDERICK AT THE MILL.</div></div>

<p>The king, upon receiving these strange and unexpected tidings,
immediately rode into Lowen. It was an early hour in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
morning. He entered the place, not as a king and a conqueror,
but as a starving fugitive, exhausted with fatigue, anxiety, and
sleeplessness. It is said that his hunger was so great that he
stopped at a little shop on the corner of the market-place, where
“widow Panzern” served him with a cup of coffee and a cold
roast fowl. Thus slightly refreshed, the intensely humiliated
young king galloped back to his victorious army at Mollwitz,
having been absent from it, in his terror-stricken flight, for sixteen
hours.</p>

<p>The chagrin of Frederick in view of this adventure may be
inferred from the fact that, during the whole remainder of his
life, he was never known to make any allusion to it whatever.</p>

<p>After the king, swept away in the wreck of his right wing of
cavalry, had left the field, and was spurring his horse in his impetuous
flight, his generals in the centre and on the left, in command
of infantry so highly disciplined that every man would
stand at his post until he died, resolutely maintained the battle.
Frederick William had drilled these men for twenty years as
men were never drilled before or since, converting them into
mere machines. They were wielded by their officers as they
themselves handled their muskets. Five successive cavalry
charges these cast-iron men resisted. They stood like rocks dashing
aside the torrent. The assailing columns melted before their
terrible fire—they discharging five shots to the Austrians’ two.</p>

<p>After the fifth charge, the Austrians, dispirited, and leaving
the snow plain crimsoned with the blood and covered with the
bodies of their slain, withdrew out of ball range. Torn and exhausted,
they could not be driven by their officers forward to
another assault. The battle had now lasted for five hours.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
Night was at hand, for the sun had already set. The repulsed
Austrians were collected in scattered and confused bands. The
experienced eye of General Schwerin saw that the hour for decisive
action had come. He closed up his ranks, ordered every
band to play its most spirited air, and gave the order “Forward.”
An Austrian officer, writing the next week, describes
the scene.</p>

<p>“I can well say,” he writes, “that I never in my life saw any
thing more beautiful. They marched with the greatest steadiness,
arrow straight and their front like a line, as if they had
been upon parade. The glitter of their clear arms shone strangely
in the setting sun, and the fire from them went on no otherwise
than a continued peal of thunder. The spirits of our army
sank altogether, the foot plainly giving way, the horse refusing
to come forward—all things wavering toward dissolution.”</p>

<p>The Austrians had already lost, in killed, wounded, and missing,
four thousand four hundred and ten men. And though the
Prussians had lost four thousand six hundred and thirteen, still
their infantry lines had never for a moment wavered; and now,
with floating banners and peals of music, they were advancing
with the strides of conquerors.</p>

<p>Thus circumstanced, General Neipperg gave the order to retreat.
At the double quick, the Austrians retired back through
the street of Mollwitz, hurried across the River Laugwitz by a
bridge, and, turning short to the south, continued their retreat
toward Grottkau. They left behind them nine of their own
guns, and eight of those which they had captured from the Prussians.
The Prussians, exhausted by the long battle, their cavalry
mostly dispersed and darkness already enveloping them, did
not attempt any vigorous pursuit. They bivouacked on the
grounds, or quartered themselves in the villages from which the
Austrians had fled.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, April 12, two days after the battle, Frederick
wrote to his sister Wilhelmina from Ohlau as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest Sister</span>,—I have the satisfaction to inform you
that we have yesterday<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> totally beaten the Austrians. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
have lost more than five thousand men in killed, wounded, and
prisoners. We have lost Prince Frederick, brother of Margraf
Karl; General Schulenberg, Wartensleben of the Carabineers,
and many other officers. Our troops did miracles, and the result
shows as much. It was one of the rudest battles fought
within the memory of man.</p>

<p>“I am sure you will take part in this happiness, and that you
will not doubt the tenderness with which I am, dearest sister,
yours wholly,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Frederick</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>The king’s intimate friend, Jordan, had accompanied him as
far as Breslau. There he remained, anxiously awaiting the issue
of the conflict. On the 11th, the day succeeding the battle, he
wrote from Breslau to the king as follows:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sire</span>,—Yesterday I was in terrible alarms. The sound of
the cannon heard, the smoke of powder visible from the steeple-tops
here, all led us to suspect that there was a battle going on.
Glorious confirmation of it this morning. Nothing but rejoicing
among all the Protestant inhabitants, who had begun to be in
apprehension from the rumors which the other party took pleasure
in spreading. Persons who were in the battle can not
enough celebrate the coolness and bravery of your majesty.
For myself, I am at the overflowing point. I have run about all
day announcing this glorious news to the Berliners who are here.
In my life I have never felt a more perfect satisfaction. One
finds at the corner of every street an orator of the people celebrating
the warlike feats of your majesty’s troops. I have often,
in my idleness, assisted at these discourses; not artistic eloquence,
it must be owned, but gushing full from the heart.”</p>

<p>Frederick immediately sent an announcement of the victory
to his friend Voltaire. It does not appear that he alluded to his
own adventures. Voltaire received the note when in the theatre
at Lisle, while listening to the first performance of his tragedy
of <cite>Mahomet</cite>. He read the account to the audience between
the acts. It was received with great applause. “You will see,”
said Voltaire, “that this piece of Mollwitz will secure the success
of mine.” <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vous verrez que cette piece de Mollwitz fera réussir
la miene.</i></p>

<p>The distinguished philosopher Maupertuis accompanied Frederick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
on this campaign. Following the king to the vicinity of
the field of battle, he took a post of observation at a safe distance,
that he might witness the spectacle. Carlyle, in his peculiar
style of word-painting, describes the issue as follows:</p>

<p>“The sage Maupertuis, for example, had climbed some tree, or
place of impregnability, hoping to see the battle there. And he
did see it much too clearly at last! In such a tide of charging
and chasing on that Right Wing, and round all the field in the
Prussian rear; in such wide bickering and boiling of Horse-currents,
which fling out round all the Prussian rear-quarters such
a spray of Austrian Hussars for one element, Maupertuis, I have
no doubt, wishes much he were at home doing his sines and
tangents. An Austrian Hussar party gets sight of him on his
tree or other stand-point (Voltaire says elsewhere he was mounted
on an ass, the malicious spirit!)—too certain the Austrian
Hussars got sight of him; his purse, gold watch, all he has of
movable, is given frankly; all will not do. There are frills
about the man, fine laces, cloth; a goodish yellow wig on him
for one thing. Their Slavonic dialect, too fatally intelligible by
the pantomime accompanying it, forces sage Maupertuis from his
tree or stand-point; the big red face flurried into scarlet, I can
fancy, or scarlet and ashy-white mixed; and—Let us draw a
veil over it. He is next seen shirtless, the once very haughty,
blustery, and now much humiliated man; still conscious of supreme
acumen, insight, and pure science; and, though an Austrian
prisoner and a monster of rags, struggling to believe that he
is a genius, and the Trismegistus of mankind. What a pickle!”</p>

<p>While in this deplorable condition, Maupertuis was found by
the Prince of Lichtenstein, an Austrian officer who had met him
in Paris. The prince rescued him from his brutal captors and
supplied him with clothing. He was, however, taken to Vienna
as a prisoner of war, where he was placed on parole. Voltaire,
whose unamiable nature was pervaded by a very marked vein
of malignity, made himself very merry over the misfortunes of
the philosopher. As Maupertuis glided about the streets of Vienna
for a time in obscurity, the newspapers began to speak of
his scientific celebrity. He was thus brought into notice. The
queen treated him with distinction. The Grand-duke Francis
drew his own watch from his pocket, and presented it to Maupertuis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
in recompense for the one he had lost. Eventually he
was released, and, loaded with many presents, was sent to Brittany.</p>

<p>In the account which Frederick gave, some years after, of this
campaign, in his <cite>Histoire de Mons Temps</cite>, he wrote:</p>

<p>“The contest between General Neipperg and myself seemed
to be which should commit the most faults. Mollwitz was the
school of the king and his troops. That prince reflected profoundly
upon all the faults and errors he had fallen into, and
tried to correct them for the future.”</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">After</span> the battle of Mollwitz, General Neipperg withdrew
the defeated Austrian army to the vicinity of Neisse, where he
strongly intrenched himself. Frederick encamped his troops
around Brieg, and made vigorous preparations to carry the place
by storm. With great energy he pushed forward his works,
and in less than three weeks was ready for the assault. On the
night of April 26 there was a tempest of extraordinary violence,
which was followed, the next night, by a dead calm, a cloudless
sky, and a brilliant moon. On both sides of the River Oder,
upon which Brieg was situated, there was an open champaign
country. Several bridges crossed the river. At a fixed moment
two thousand diggers were collected, at appointed stations, divided
into twelve equal parties. With the utmost exactness
they were equipped with all the necessary implements. These
diggers, with spade and pickaxe, and yet thoroughly armed, were
preceded a few yards by covering battalions, who, having stealthily
and silently obtained the position assigned to them, were to
lie flat upon the ground. Not a gun was to be fired; not a
word was to be spoken save in a whisper; not even a pipe was
to be lighted. Some engineers were to mark out with a straw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
rope, just in the rear of the covering party, the line of the first
parallel. Every imaginable contingency was provided for, and
each man was to attend to his individual duty with the precision
of clock-work.</p>

<p>Precisely at midnight all were in silent, rapid motion. The
march of half an hour brought them to their appointed stations.
The soft and sandy soil was easily shoveled. Every man plied
pick and spade with intensest energy. As the town clock of
Brieg struck one, they had so far dug themselves in as to be
quite sheltered from the fire of the hostile batteries, should the
guns open upon them. Before the dawn of day they had two
batteries, of twenty-five guns each, in position, and several mortars
ready for action.</p>

<p>Thus far the enemy had no suspicion of the movement. But
now the sun was rising, and, almost simultaneously on both
sides, the roar of battle commenced. The positions had been so
adroitly taken as to bring three Prussian guns to bear upon
each gun of the Austrians. The Prussian gunners, drilled to the
utmost possible accuracy and precision of fire, poured into the
city a terrific tempest of shot and shells. Every thing had been
so carefully arranged that, for six days and nights, with scarcely
a moment’s intermission, the doomed city was assailed with such
a tornado of cannonading and bombardment as earth had seldom,
if ever, witnessed before.</p>

<p>The city took fire in many places; magazines were consumed;
the ducal palace was wrapped in flames. Nearly fifteen thousand
cannon-balls, and over two thousand bombs, were hurled
crashing through the thronged dwellings. Many of the Austrian
guns were silenced. General Piccolomini, who was intrusted
with the defense of the place, could stand it no longer. On
the 4th of May he raised above the walls the white flag of surrender.
The gallant general was treated magnanimously. He
was invited to dine with Frederick, and, with the garrison, was
permitted to retire to Neisse, pledged not to serve against the
Prussians for two years. The town had been nearly demolished
by the war-tempest which had beat so fiercely upon it. Frederick
immediately commenced repairing the ruins and strengthening
the fortifications.</p>

<p>All Europe was thrown into commotion by this bold and successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
invasion of Silesia. France was delighted, for Prussia
was weakening Austria. England was alarmed. The weakening
of Austria was strengthening France, England’s dreaded rival.
And Hanover was menaced by the Prussian army at Götten,
under the Old Dessauer. The British Parliament voted an
additional subsidy of £300,000 to Maria Theresa. Two hundred
thousand had already been granted her. This, in all, amounted
to the sum of two million five hundred thousand dollars. Envoys
from all the nations of Europe were sent to Frederick’s encampment
at Strehlen, in the vicinity of Brieg. Some were sent
seeking his alliance, some with terms of compromise, and all to
watch his proceedings. The young king was not only acquiring
the territory which he sought, but seemed to be gaining that renown
which he had so eagerly coveted. He did not feel strong
enough to make an immediate attack upon the Austrian army,
which General Neipperg held, in an almost impregnable position,
behind the ramparts of Neisse. For two months he remained
at Strehlen, making vigorous preparations for future
movements, and his mind much engrossed with diplomatic intrigues.
Strehlen is a pretty little town, nestled among the hills,
about twenty-five miles west of Brieg, and thirty northwest of
Neisse. The troops were mainly encamped in tents on the fields
around. The embassadors from the great monarchies of Europe
were generally sumptuously lodged in Strehlen, or in Breslau,
which was a beautiful city about thirty miles north of Strehlen.
Baron Bielfeld in the following terms describes the luxury in
which the Spanish minister indulged:</p>

<p>“Each of these ministers makes a most brilliant figure, and
never have I seen one travel with more ease and convenience,
more elegance and grandeur, than does the Marquis of Montijo.
Wherever he stops to dine or sup, he finds a room hung with
the richest tapestry, and the floor covered with Turkey carpets,
with velvet chairs, and every other kind of convenience; a table
sumptuously served, the choicest wines, and a dessert of fruit and
confectionery that Paris itself could not excel. This kind of enchantment,
this real miracle in Germany, is performed by means
of three baggage-wagons, of which two always go before the embassador,
and carry with them every thing necessary for his reception.
When they arrive in some poor village, the domestics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
that accompany each wagon immediately clear and clean some
chamber, fix the tapestry by rings to the walls, cover the floor
with carpets, and furnish the kitchen and cellar with every kind
of necessary.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>Speaking of Frederick at this time, Bielfeld says: “Notwithstanding
all the fatigues of war, the king is in perfect health,
and more gay and pleasant than ever. All who approach his
majesty meet with a most gracious reception. In the midst of
his camp, and at the head of sixty thousand Prussians, our monarch
appears to me with a new and superior air of greatness.”</p>

<p>Circumstances had already rendered Frederick one of the most
important personages in Europe. He could ally himself with
France, and humble Austria; or he could ally himself with England
and Austria, and crush France. All the lesser lights in
the Continental firmament circulated around these central luminaries.
Consequently Frederick was enabled to take a conspicuous
part in all the diplomatic intrigues which were then agitating
the courts of Europe.</p>

<p>On the 7th of May, three days after the capture of Brieg, Lord
Hyndford, the English embassador, arrived at the camp of Frederick,
and obtained an audience with his majesty. It was eleven
o’clock in the forenoon. He gave his government a very minute
narrative of the interview. The following particulars, gleaned
from that narrative, will interest the reader. It will be remembered
that Frederick cherished a strong antipathy against his
uncle, George II. of England.</p>

<p>Lord Hyndford commenced his communication by assuring his
majesty of the friendly feelings and good wishes of the English
government. Frederick listened with much impatience, and soon
interrupted him, exclaiming passionately,</p>

<p>“How is it possible, my lord, to believe things so contradictory?
It is mighty fine, all this that you now tell me, on the
part of the King of England. But how does it correspond with
his last speech in Parliament, and with the doings of his ministers
at Petersburg and at the Hague, to stir up allies against
me? I have reason to doubt the sincerity of the King of England.
Perhaps he means to amuse me. But” (with an oath<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
“he is mistaken. I will risk every thing rather than abate the
least of my pretensions.”</p>

<p>Lord Hyndford, evidently embarrassed, for the facts were
strongly against him, endeavored, in some additional remarks, to
assume ignorance of any unfriendly action on the part of the
British government. The king again, in a loud and angry tone,
replied,</p>

<p>“My lord, there seems to be a contradiction in all this. The
King of England, in his letter, tells me you are instructed as to
every thing, and yet you pretend ignorance. But I am perfectly
informed of all. And I should not be surprised if, after all these
fine words, you should receive some strong letter or resolution
for me.” Then, turning to his secretary, he added, sarcastically,
“Write down that my lord would be surprised to receive such
instruction.”</p>

<p>Lord Hyndford, who says that by this rude assailment he was
put extremely upon his guard, rejoined:</p>

<p>“Europe is under the necessity of taking some speedy resolution,
things are in such a state of crisis. Like a fever in a human
body, got to such a height that quinquina becomes necessary.
Shall we apply to Vienna, your majesty?”</p>

<p>A transient smile flitted across the king’s countenance. Then,
looking cold again, he added, “Follow your own will in that.”</p>

<p>“Would your majesty,” Lord Hyndford replied, “engage to
stand by his excellency Gotter’s original offer at Vienna on your
part? That is, would you agree, in consideration of the surrender
to you of Lower Silesia and Breslau, to assist the Queen of
Austria, with all your troops, for the maintenance of the Pragmatic
Sanction, and to vote for the Grand-duke Francis as emperor?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the monosyllabic reply.</p>

<p>“What was the sum of money your majesty then offered the
Queen of Austria?” Lord Hyndford inquired.</p>

<p>The king hesitated, as though he had forgotten. But his secretary
answered, “Three million florins ($1,500,000).”</p>

<p>“I should not value the money,” the king added. “If money
would content her I would give more.”</p>

<p>After a long pause Lord Hyndford inquired, “Would your
majesty consent to an armistice?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
“Yes,” Frederick replied; “but for not less than six months”
(counting on his fingers from May to December)—“till December
1. The season then would be so far gone that they could
do nothing.”</p>

<p>As the secretary, Podewils, had been taking notes, Lord Hyndford
requested permission to look at them, that he might see
that no mistake had been made. The king assented, and then
Lord Hyndford bowed himself out. Thus ended the audience.</p>

<p>A few days after this interview, the Dutch embassador, General
Ginckel, arrived with the Resolution from the English and
Dutch courts, demanding that the king should evacuate Silesia.
Lord Hyndford was much embarrassed, apprehending that the
presentation of the summons at that time would work only mischief.
He persuaded General Ginckel to delay the presentation
until he could send a courier to England for instructions. In a
fortnight the courier returned with the order that the Resolution
was immediately to be presented to his Prussian majesty.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Frederick, who kept himself thoroughly informed
of all these events, signed secretly, on the 5th of June, a
treaty of intimate alliance with France. Though he had not yet
received the Joint Resolution of the English and Dutch courts,
he was well aware of its existence, and the next day sent to his
envoy, M. Räsfeld, at the Hague, the following dispatch:</p>

<p>“You will beforehand inform the high mightinesses in regard
to that Advice of April 24th, which they determined on giving
me, through his excellency General Ginckel, along with his excellency
Lord Hyndford, that such advice can be considered by
me only as a blind complaisance to the court of Vienna’s improper
urgencies. That for certain I will not quit Silesia till
my claims be satisfied. And the longer I am forced to continue
warring for them here, the higher they will rise.”</p>

<p>The plan of France, as conceived and pushed resolutely forward
by the Count of Belleisle, the renowned minister of Louis
XV., was to divide Germany into four small kingdoms of about
equal power, Bavaria, Saxony, Prussia, and Austria. The King
of Bavaria, as one of the protégés of France, was to be chosen
Emperor of Germany. To accomplish this, Austria was to be
reduced to a second-rate power by despoiling the young queen,
Maria Theresa, of large portions of her territory, and annexing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
the provinces wrested from her to the petty states of Prussia,
Bavaria, and Saxony, thus sinking Austria to an equality with
them. France, the grand nation, would then be indisputably
the leading power in Europe. By bribery, intimidation, and inciting
one kingdom against another, the court of Versailles could
control the policy of the whole Continent. Magnificent as was
this plan, many circumstances seemed then combining to render
it feasible. The King of Prussia, inspired simply by the desire
of enlarging his kingdom by making war against Austria, and
striving to wrest Silesia from the realms of Maria Theresa, was
co-operating, in the most effectual way possible, to further the
designs of France. And it had now also become a matter of
great moment to Frederick that he should secure the alliance of
the court of Versailles.</p>

<p>All the courts of Europe were involved in these intrigues,
which led to minor complications which it would be in vain to
attempt to unravel. In the secret treaty into which Frederick
entered with France on the 5th of June, 1741, the Count of Belleisle
engaged, in behalf of his master, Louis XV., to incite Sweden
to declare war against Russia, that the semi-barbaric power of
the North, just beginning to emerge into greatness, might be so
occupied as not to be able to render any assistance to Austria.
France also agreed to guarantee Lower Silesia, with Breslau, to
Frederick, and to send two armies, of forty thousand men each,
one across the Upper and the other across the Lower Rhine, to
co-operate with his Prussian majesty. The forty thousand men
on the Upper Rhine were to take position in the vicinity of the
Electorate of Hanover, which belonged to George II. of England,
prepared to act immediately in concert with the Prussian army
at Götten under the “Old Dessauer,” in seizing Hanover resistlessly,
should England make the slightest move toward sending
troops to the aid of Maria Theresa.</p>

<p>The prospects of Maria Theresa seemed now quite desperate.
We know not that history records a more inglorious act than
that Europe should have thus combined to take advantage of
the youth and inexperience of this young queen, weeping over
the grave of her father, and trembling in view of her own approaching
hour of anguish, by wresting from her the inheritance
which had descended to her from her ancestors. France and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
Germany, inspired by the most intense motives of selfish ambition,
were to fall upon her, while the most effectual precautions
were adopted to prevent Russia and England from coming to
her aid.</p>

    <div class="caption">FREDERICK’S INTERVIEW WITH VALORI.</div></div>

<p>In carrying forward these intrigues at the camp of Frederick,
the Count of Belleisle had an associate minister in the embassy,
M. De Valori. A slight incident occurred in connection with
this minister which would indicate, in the view of most persons,
that Frederick did not cherish a very high sense of honor. M.
Valori was admitted to an audience with his Prussian majesty.
During the interview, as the French minister drew his hand from
his pocket, he accidentally dropped a note upon the floor. Frederick,
perceiving it, slyly placed his foot upon it. As soon as the
minister had bowed himself out, Frederick eagerly seized the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
note and read it. It contained some secret instructions to M.
Valori from the French court, directing him not to give Glatz
to his Prussian majesty if it could possibly be avoided. Frederick
did not perceive any thing ignoble in this act of his, for he
records it himself;<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> neither does Mr. Carlyle condemn him.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
Most readers will probably regard it as highly dishonorable.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June the English and Dutch ministers, not yet
aware of the alliance into which Frederick had entered with
France, presented the joint resolution of their two courts, exhorting
Frederick to withdraw his army from Silesia. Lord Hyndford,
who was somewhat annoyed by the apparent impolicy of
the measure just at that time, solicited and obtained a private
audience with the king, hoping by apologies and explanations
to make the summons a little less unpalatable to his majesty.
In the brief interview which ensued Lord Hyndford appealed to
the magnanimity of the king, declaring that it would be generous
and noble for him to accept moderate terms from Austria.
The king angrily interrupted him, saying,</p>

<p>“My lord, do not talk to me of magnanimity. A prince ought,
in the first place, to consult his interest. I am not opposed to
peace. But I expect to have four duchies given me.”</p>

<p>Maria Theresa was much encouraged by the subsidy she had
received from England. She was not yet informed of the formidable
alliance into which France, with a portion of Germany,
had entered for her destruction. About the 20th of June she
left Vienna for Presburg, in Hungary, a drive of about fifty miles.
Here, on the 25th of June, 1741, she was crowned Queen of
Hungary. She was a very beautiful woman in person, devout
in spirit, and those who admire manly developments in the female
character must regard her as presenting the highest type
of womanhood. She merits the following beautiful tribute to
her worth from the pen of Carlyle:</p>

<p>“As to the brave young Queen of Hungary, my admiration
goes with that of all the world. Not in the language of flattery,
but of evident fact, the royal qualities abound in that high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
young lady. Had they left the world, and grown to mere costume
elsewhere, you might find certain of them again here.
Most brave, high and pious minded; beautiful too, and radiant
with good-nature, though of temper that will easily catch fire;
there is, perhaps, no nobler woman then living. And she fronts
the roaring elements in a truly grand, feminine manner, as if
Heaven itself and the voice of Duty called her. ‘The inheritances
which my fathers left me, we will not part with these.
Death if it so must be, but not dishonor.’</p>

<p>“This, for the present, is her method of looking at the matter;
this magnanimous, heroic, and occasionally somewhat female one.
Her husband, the grand-duke, an inert but good-tempered, well-conditioned
duke, after his sort, goes with her. Now, as always,
he follows loyally his wife’s lead, never she his. Wife being intrinsically
as well as extrinsically the better man, what other
can he do?”</p>

<p>The ceremony of coronation was attended, near Presburg, on
the 25th of June, with much semi-barbaric splendor, as the Iron
Crown<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> of St. Stephen was placed upon the pale, beautiful brow
of the young wife and mother. All the renowned chivalry of
Hungary were assembled upon that field. They came in gorgeous
costume, with embroidered banners, and accompanied by
imposing retinues. At the close of the ceremonies, the queen,
who was distinguished as a bold rider, mounted a swift charger,
and, followed by a long retinue of Magyar warriors, galloped to
the top of a small eminence artificially constructed for the occasion,
called the Königsburg, or King’s Hill, where she drew her
sword, and, flourishing it toward the four quarters of the heavens,
bade defiance to any adversary who should venture to question
her claims. The knightly warriors who crowded the plain
flashed their swords in the sunlight, as with one accord, with
chivalric devotion, they vowed fidelity to their queen.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">Gradually</span> the secret treaty which allied France, Bavaria, and
Prussia, and it was not known how many other minor powers,
against Austria, came to light. Two French armies of fifty thousand
men each were on the march to act in co-operation with
Frederick. England, trembling from fear of the loss of Hanover,
dared not move. The Aulic Council at Vienna, in a panic, “fell
back into their chairs like dead men.” The ruin of Maria Theresa
and the fatal dismemberment of Austria seemed inevitable.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the young queen, urged by her
council and by the English court, very reluctantly consented to
propose terms of compromise to Frederick. Sir Thomas Robinson,
subsequently Earl of Grantham, was sent from Vienna to
Breslau to confer with the British minister there, Lord Hyndford,
and with him to visit Frederick, at his camp at Strehlen,
in the attempt to adjust the difficulties. The curious interview
which ensued has been minutely described by Sir Thomas Robinson.
It took place under the royal canvas tent of his Prussian
majesty at 11 o’clock A.M. of the 7th of August, 1741.</p>

<p>The two English gentlemen, stout, burly, florid men, were
dressed in the gorgeous court costume of those days. Each
wore a large, frizzled, powdered wig. Their shirts were heavily
ruffled in the bosoms and at the wrists. Their coats, of antique
cut, were covered with embroidery of gold lace. Their waistcoats
hung down in deep flaps, and large buckles adorned their
shoes.</p>

<p>Frederick was a trig, slender young man of twenty-nine years.
He was dressed in a closely-fitting blue coat, with buff breeches
and high cavalry boots. He wore a plumed hat, which he courteously
raised as the embassadors entered his tent. The scene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
which ensued was substantially as follows, omitting those passages
which were of no permanent interest. After sundry preliminary
remarks, Sir Thomas Robinson said,</p>

<p>“I am authorized to offer your majesty two million guilders
[$1,000,000] if your majesty will consent to relinquish this enterprise
and retire from Silesia.”</p>

<div id="ip_276" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.6875em;">
  <img src="images/i_276.jpg" width="459" height="598" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">FREDERICK AND THE BRITISH MINISTERS.</div></div>

<p>“Retire from Silesia!” exclaimed the king, vehemently. “And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
for money? Do you take me for a beggar? Retire from Silesia,
in the conquest of which I have expended so much blood
and treasure! No, sir, no. That is not to be thought of. If
you have no better proposals to suggest, it is not worth while
talking.”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas, somewhat discomposed, apologetically intimated
that that was not all he had to offer.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the king, impatiently; “let us see, then, what
there is more.”</p>

<p>“I am permitted,” the embassador said, “to offer your majesty
the whole of Austrian Guelderland. It lies contiguous to your
majesty’s possessions in the Rhine country. It will be a very
important addition to those possessions. I am permitted to say
the whole of Austrian Guelderland.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” exclaimed the king, with an air of real
or affected surprise. Then, turning to his secretary, M. Podewils,
he inquired, “How much of Guelderland is theirs, and not ours
already?”</p>

<p>“Almost none,” M. Podewils replied.</p>

<p>Here the king quite lost his temper. In a loud tone and with
angry gesticulation he exclaimed, “Do you offer me such rags
and rubbish, such paltry scrapings, for all my just claims in Silesia?”
And so he ran on for quite a length of time, with ever-increasing
violence, fanning himself into a flame of indignation.</p>

<p>“His contempt,” writes Sir Thomas in his narrative, “was so
great, and was expressed in such violent terms, that now, if ever,
was the time to make the last effort. A moment longer was not
to be lost, to hinder the king from dismissing us.”</p>

<p>“I am also permitted, sire,” said Sir Thomas, “to add the Duchy
of Limburg. It is a duchy of great wealth and resources, so valuable
that the Elector Palatine was willing to give in exchange
for it the whole Duchy of Berg.”</p>

<p>“It is inconceivable to me,” Frederick replied, “how Austria
should dare to think of such a proposal. Limburg! Are there
not solemn engagements upon Austria which render every inch
of ground in the Netherlands inalienable?”</p>

<p>“These engagements,” said Sir Thomas, “are good as against
the French, your majesty. But the Barrier treaty, confirmed at
Utrecht, was for our benefit and that of Holland.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
“That is your interpretation,” said Frederick. “But the
French assert that it was an arrangement made in their favor.”</p>

<p>“Your majesty,” Sir Thomas rejoined, “by a little engineering
art, could render Limburg impregnable to the French or any
others.”</p>

<p>“I have not the least desire,” the king replied, “to aggrandize
myself in those parts, or to spend money in fortifying there. It
would be useless to me. Am I not fortifying Brieg and Glogau?
These are enough for one who wishes to live well with his neighbors.
Neither the Dutch nor the French have offended me, nor
will I offend them by acquisitions in the Netherlands. Besides,
who would guarantee them?”</p>

<p>“The proposal,” Sir Thomas replied, “is to give guarantees at
once.”</p>

<p>“Guarantees!” exclaimed the king, scornfully. “Who minds
or keeps guarantees in this age? Has not France guaranteed
the Pragmatic Sanction? Has not England? Why do you not
all fly to the queen’s succor?”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas, who was not aware of the engagement into which
the allies had entered to keep Russia busy by a war with Sweden,
intimated that there were powers which might yet come to
the rescue of the queen, and mentioned Russia as one.</p>

<p>The king, with a very complaisant smile, said, “Russia, my
good sir—It is not proper for me to explain myself, but I have
means to keep the Russians employed.”</p>

<p>“Russia,” added Sir Thomas, with some stateliness of utterance,
“is not the only power which has engagements with Austria,
and which must keep them too; so that, however averse to
a breach—”</p>

<p>Here the king interrupted him, and with scornful gesture, “laying
his finger on his nose,” and in loud tones, exclaimed,</p>

<p>“No threats, sir, if you please, no threats.”</p>

<p>Lord Hyndford here came to the rescue of his colleague, and
said, meekly,</p>

<p>“I am sure his excellency had no such meaning, sire. His
excellency will advance nothing so very contrary to his instructions.”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Robinson added, “Sire, I am not talking of what
this power or that means to do, but of what will come of itself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
To prophesy is not to threaten, sire. It is my zeal for the public
good which brought me here, and—”</p>

<p>Again the king interrupted him, saying, “The public will be
much obliged to you, sir! But hear me. With respect to Russia,
you know how matters stand. From the King of Poland I
have nothing to fear. As for the King of England, he is my relation.
If he do not attack me, I shall not him. If he do attack
me, the Prince of Anhalt, with my army at Götten, will take
care of him.”</p>

<p>“It is the common rumor now,” Sir Thomas replied, “that
your majesty, after the 12th of August, will join the French.
Sire, I venture to hope not. Austria prefers your friendship;
but if your majesty disdain Austria’s advances, what is it to do?
Austria must throw itself entirely into the hands of France, and
endeavor to outbid your majesty.”</p>

<p>This was a very serious suggestion. None of these sovereigns
professed to be influenced by any other considerations than their
own interests. And it was manifest that Austria could easily
outbid Prussia, if determined to purchase the French alliance.
For a moment the king was silent, apparently somewhat perplexed.
He then said,</p>

<p>“I am at the head of an army which has already vanquished
the enemy, and which is ready to meet the enemy again. The
country which alone I desire is already conquered and securely
held. This is all I want. I now have it. I will and must keep
it. Shall I be bought out of this country? Never! I will
sooner perish in it with all my troops. With what face shall I
meet my ancestors if I abandon my right which they have transmitted
to me? My first enterprise, and to be given up lightly?</p>

<p>“Have I need of peace? Let those who need it give me what
I want, or let them fight me again and be beaten again. Have
they not given whole kingdoms to Spain? And to me they can
not spare a few trifling principalities. If the queen do not now
grant me all I require, I shall, in four weeks, demand four principalities
more. I now demand the whole of Lower Silesia, Breslau
included. With that answer you can return to Vienna.”</p>

<p>“With that answer!” Sir Thomas replied, in tones of surprise.
“Is your majesty serious? Is that your majesty’s deliberate
answer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
“Yes, I say,” the king rejoined. “That is my answer, and I
will never give any other.”</p>

<p>Both of the English ministers, in much agitation, spoke together.
The king, impatiently interrupting them, said,</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, gentlemen, it is of no use to think about it.”</p>

<p>Taking off his hat, he slightly saluted them, and retired behind
the curtain into the interior tent.</p>

<p>A brief account of this interview has been given by Frederick,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
and also a very minute narrative by Sir Thomas Robinson, in
his official report to his government. There is no essential discrepancy
between the two statements. Frederick alludes rather
contemptuously to the pompous airs of Sir Thomas, saying that
“he negotiated in a wordy, high, droning way, as if he were
speaking in Parliament.” Mr. Carlyle seems to be entirely in
sympathy with Frederick in his invasion of Silesia. The reader
will peruse with interest his graphic, characteristic comments
upon this interview:</p>

<p>“The unsuccessfulest negotiation well imaginable by a public
man. Strehlen, Monday, 7th August, 1741—Frederick has vanished
into the interior of his tent, and the two diplomatic gentlemen,
the wind struck out of them in this manner, remain gazing
at one another. Here, truly, is a young, royal gentleman that
knows his own mind, while so many do not. Unspeakable imbroglio
of negotiations, mostly insane, welters over all the earth;
the Belleisles, the Aulic Councils, the British Georges, heaping
coil upon coil; and here, notably in that now so extremely sordid
murk of wiggeries, inane diplomacies, and solemn deliriums,
dark now and obsolete to all creatures, steps forth one little human
figure, with something of sanity in it, like a star, like a
gleam of steel, sheering asunder your big balloons, and letting
out their diplomatic hydrogen. Salutes with his hat, ‘Gentlemen,
gentlemen, it is of no use!’ and vanishes into the interior
of his tent.”</p>

<p>The next day the two British ministers dined with Frederick.
The king was in reality, or assumed to be, in exultant spirits.
He joked and bantered his guests even upon those great issues
which were threatening to deluge Europe in blood. As they
took leave, intending to return to Vienna through Neisse, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
was held by the Austrian army, the king said to Sir Thomas
Robinson, derisively,</p>

<p>“As you pass through Neisse, please present my compliments
to Marshal Neipperg; and you can say, your excellency, that I
hope to have the pleasure of calling upon him one of these days.”</p>

<p>It seemed to be the policy of Frederick to assume a very trifling,
care-for-nothing air, as though he were engaged in very
harmless child’s play. He threw out jokes, and wrote ludicrous
letters to M. Jordan and M. Algarotti. But behind this exterior
disguise it is manifest that all the energies of his soul were
aroused, and that, with sleepless vigilance, he was watching every
event, and providing for every possible emergence.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Breslau, whose inhabitants were
mainly Protestant, and which was one of the so-called free cities
of Germany, was surrendered to Frederick under peculiar conditions.
It was to remain, in its internal government, in all respects
exactly as it had been, with the simple exception that it
was to recognize the sovereignty of Prussia instead of that of
Austria. Its strict neutrality was to be respected. It was to
be protected by its own garrison. No Prussian soldier could
enter with any weapons but side-arms. The king himself, in entering
the city, could be accompanied only by thirty guards.</p>

<p>When under the sovereignty of Austria, though the Protestants
were not persecuted, very decided favor was shown to the
Catholics. But the influence of Protestant Prussia was to place
both parties on a perfect equality. This greatly annoyed the
Catholics. Certain Catholic ladies of rank, with a few leading
citizens, entered into a secret society, and kept the court of Vienna
informed of every thing which transpired in Breslau. They
also entered into intimate communication with General Neipperg,
entreating him to come to their rescue. They assured him
that if he would suddenly appear before their gates with his
army, or with a strong detachment, the conspiring Catholics
would open the gates, and he could rush in and take possession
of the city.</p>

<p>But the ever-vigilant Frederick had smuggled a “false sister”
into the society of the Catholic ladies, who kept him informed
of every measure that was proposed. At the very hour when
Frederick was dining with the two English ministers, and making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
himself so merry with jests and banter, he was aware that
General Neipperg, with the whole Austrian army, was crossing
the River Neisse, on the march, by a route thirty miles west of
his encampment, to take Breslau by surprise. But he had already
adopted effectual measures to thwart their plans.</p>

<p>On the 10th of August there was a magnificent review of the
Prussian army on the plain of Strehlin, to which all the foreign
embassadors were invited. During the night of the 9th, General
Schwerin and Prince Leopold, with eight thousand Prussian
troops, horse and foot, arrived in the southwestern suburbs of
Breslau, and, at six o’clock in the morning, demanded simply a
passage through the city for their regiments and baggage, on the
march to attack a marauding band of the Austrians on the other
side of the Oder.</p>

<p>The rule, in such cases, was that a certain number of companies
were to be admitted at a time. The gate was then to be closed
until they had marched through the city and out at the opposite
gate. After this another detachment was to be admitted,
and so on, until all had passed through. But General Schwerin
so contrived it, by stratagem, as to crowd in a whole regiment at
once. Instead of marching through Breslau, to the surprise of
the inhabitants, he directed his steps to the market-place, where
he encamped and took possession of the city, admitting the remainder
of his regiments. In an hour and a half the whole thing
was done, and the streets were strongly garrisoned by Prussian
troops. The majority of the inhabitants, being Protestant, were
well pleased, and received the achievement with laughter. Many
cheers resounded through the streets, with shouts of “Frederick
and Silesia forever.” All the foreign ministers in Breslau, and
the magistrates of the city, had been lured to Strehlin to witness
the grand review.</p>

<p>Frederick had caused signal cannon to be placed at suitable
points between Breslau and Strehlin, which, by transmitting reports,
should give him as early intelligence as possible of the
success of the enterprise. About noon, in the midst of the grand
manœuvrings on the parade-ground, one distant cannon-shot was
heard, to the great satisfaction of Frederick, who alone understood
its significance.</p>

<p>General Neipperg had advanced as far as Baumgarten when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
he heard of this entire circumvention of his plans. Exasperated
by the discomfiture, he pushed boldly forward to seize Schweidnitz,
where Frederick had a large magazine, which was supposed
not to be very strongly protected. But the vigilant Frederick
here again thwarted the Austrian general. Either anticipating
the movement, or receiving immediate information of it, he had
thrown out some strong columns to Reichenbach, where they so
effectually intrenched themselves as to bar, beyond all hope of
passage, the road to Schweidnitz. General Neipperg had advanced
but half a day’s march from Baumgarten when he heard
of this. He ordered a halt, and retraced his steps as far as Frankenstein,
where he had a very strongly intrenched camp.</p>

<p>Frederick soon followed the Austrians with his whole army,
hoping to bring them to a decisive battle. But General Neipperg
was conscious that he was unable to cope with the Prussian
army in the open field. For a week there was manœuvring
and counter-manœuvring with great skill on both sides, General
Neipperg baffling all the endeavors of Frederick to bring him to
a general action.</p>

<p>At length Frederick, weary of these unavailing efforts, dashed
off in rapid march toward the River Neisse, and with his vanguard,
on the 11th of September, crossed the river at the little
town of Woitz, a few miles above the city. The river was speedily
spanned with his pontoon bridges. As the whole army hurried
forward to effect the passage, Frederick, to his surprise, found
the Austrian army directly before him, occupying a position from
which it could not be forced, and where it could not be turned.
For two days Frederick very earnestly surveyed the region, and
then, recrossing the river and gathering in his pontoons, passed
rapidly down the stream on the left or northern bank, and, after
a brief encampment of a few days, crossed the river fifteen miles
below the city. He then threw his army into the rear of Neipperg’s,
so as to cut off his communications and his daily convoys
of food. He thus got possession again of Oppeln, of the strong
castle of Friedland, and of the country generally between the
Oder and the Neisse rivers.</p>

<p>General Neipperg cautiously advanced toward him, and encamped
in the vicinity of Steinau—the same Steinau which but
a few weeks before had been laid in ashes as the Prussian troops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
passed through it. The two armies were now separated from
each other but by an interval of about five miles. The country
was flat, and it was not probable that the contest which Frederick
so eagerly sought could long be avoided.</p>

<p>Affairs were now assuming throughout Europe a very threatening
aspect. The two French armies, of forty thousand each,
had already crossed the Rhine to join their German allies in the
war against Austria. One of these armies, to be commanded by
Belleisle, had crossed the river about thirty miles below Strasbourg
to unite with the Elector of Bavaria’s troops and march
upon Vienna. The other army, under Maillebois, had crossed
the Lower Rhine a few miles below Düsseldorf. Its mission
was, as we have mentioned, to encamp upon the frontiers of Hanover,
prepared to invade that province, in co-operation with the
Prussian troops in the camp at Göttin, should the King of England
venture to raise a hand in behalf of Austria. It was also
in position to attack and overwhelm Holland, England’s only
ally, should that power manifest the slightest opposition to the
designs of Prussia and France. At the same time, Sweden, on
the 4th of August, had declared war against Russia, so that no
help could come to Austria from that quarter. Great diplomatic
ability had been displayed in guarding every point in these
complicated measures. The French minister, Belleisle, was probably
the prominent agent in these wide-spread combinations.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>The queen, Maria Theresa, still remained at Presburg, in her
Hungarian kingdom. The Aulic Council was with her. On
the 15th of August Sir Thomas Robinson had returned to Presburg
with the intelligence of his unsuccessful mission, and of the
unrelenting determination of Frederick to prosecute the war
with the utmost vigor unless Silesia were surrendered to him.</p>

<p>These tidings struck the Austrian council with consternation.
The French armies were declared to be the finest that had ever
taken the field. The Prussian army, in stolid bravery and perfection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
of discipline, had never been surpassed. Germany was
to be cut into four equal parts, and France was to be the sovereign
power on the Continent.</p>

<p>In this terrible emergence, the queen, resolute as she was, was
almost compelled, by the importunity of her counselors, to permit
Sir Thomas Robinson, who was acting for England far more
than for Austria, to go back to Frederick with the offer so humiliating
to her, that she would surrender to him one half of Silesia
if he would withdraw his armies and enter into an alliance
with her against the French. The high-spirited queen wrung
her hands in anguish as she assented to this decision, exclaiming
passionately,</p>

<p>“If these terms are not accepted within a fortnight, I will not
be bound by them.”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas hastened back to Breslau, and anxiously entered
into communication with Lord Hyndford. The British minister
entreated the king to admit Sir Thomas to another interview,
assuring him that he came with new and more liberal propositions
for a compromise. The king replied, in substance, with his
customary brusqueness,</p>

<p>“I will not see him. I wish to listen to no more of his offers.
The sooner he takes himself away the better.”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas, deeply chagrined, hastened back to Presburg.
Acting in behalf of the English cabinet, he trembled in view of
the preponderance of the French court and of the loss of Hanover.
With the most impassioned earnestness he entreated the
queen to yield to the demands of Frederick, and thus secure his
alliance.</p>

<p>“High madam,” he said, fervently, “at this crisis, alliance with
Frederick is salvation to Austria. His continued hostility is utter
ruin. England can not help your majesty. The slightest
endeavor would cause the loss of Hanover.”</p>

<p>Thus pressed by England, and with equal earnestness by her
own Aulic Council, the queen again yielded, though almost frantic
with grief, and consented to surrender the whole of Lower
Silesia to Frederick if he would become her ally. As Frederick
had offered these terms, it was supposed, of course, that he would
accept them. Sir Thomas was again dispatched, at the top of
his speed, to convey them to the camp of Frederick. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
repulse of the king was peremptory and decisive. To Lord
Hyndford, soliciting an audience for the envoy, he replied,</p>

<p>“I will not see him. There was a time when I would have
listened to a compromise. That time has passed. I have now
entered into arrangements with France. Talk to me no more.”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas hastened back to Presburg in despair. Feeling
the “game was up,” and that there was no more hope, he asked
permission to return home. The British cabinet was in a state
of consternation. France, the dreaded rival of England, was attaining
almost sovereign power over the Continent of Europe.
Frederick himself was uneasy. He had sufficient penetration to
be fully aware that he was aiding to create a resistless power,
which might, by-and-by, crush him. Sir Thomas, in a state of
great agitation, which was manifest in his disordered style, wrote
from Presburg to Lord Hyndford at Breslau as follows. The
letter was dated September 8, 1741.</p>

<p>“My lord, I could desire your lordship to summon up, if it
were necessary, the spirit of all your lordship’s instructions, and
the sense of the king, of the Parliament, and of the whole British
nation. It is upon this great moment that depends the fate, not
of the house of Austria, not of the empire, but of the house of
Brunswick, of Great Britain, of all Europe. I verily believe the
King of Prussia himself does not know the extent of the present
danger. With whatever motive he may act, there is not one,
not that of the wildest resentment, that can blind him to this
degree—of himself perishing in the ruin he is bringing upon
others. With his concurrence, the French will, in less than six
weeks, be masters of the German empire. The weak Elector of
Bavaria is but their instrument. Prague and Vienna may, and
probably will, be taken in that short time. Will even the King
of Prussia himself be reserved to the last?”</p>

<p>These considerations probably weighed heavily upon the mind
of Frederick; for, after having so peremptorily repulsed the
queen’s messenger, he sent, on the 9th of September, Colonel
Goltz with a proposition to Lord Hyndford, which was substantially
the same which the queen in her anguish had consented
to make. The strictest secrecy was enjoined upon Colonel Goltz.
The proposition was read from a paper without signature, and
was probably in the king’s handwriting, for Lord Hyndford was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
not permitted to see the paper. He took a copy from dictation,
which was as follows:</p>

<p>“The whole of Lower Silesia; the River Neisse for the boundary;
the city of Neisse for us, as also Glutz; on the other side
of the Oder, the ancient boundary between the Duchies of Brieg
and Oppeln. Namslau for us. The affairs of religion in <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">statu
quo</i>. No dependence upon Bohemia. Cession eternal. In exchange
we will go no farther. We will besiege Neisse for form.
The commandant shall surrender and depart. We will quietly
go into winter quarters; and they (the Austrians) can take their
army where they will. Let all be finished in twelve days.”</p>

<p>But Frederick did not seem to think himself at all bound by
his treaty obligations with France to refrain from entering into
secret arrangements with the foe which would promote his interests,
however antagonistic those arrangements might be to his
assumed obligations. He was the ally of France in the attempt
to wrest territory from the young Queen of Austria, and to
weaken her power. His armies and those of France were acting
in co-operation. Frederick now proposed to the common enemy
that, if Silesia were surrendered to him, he would no longer act
in co-operation with his ally; but, that France might not discover
his perfidy, he would still pretend to make war. The
Austrians were to amuse themselves in defending Neisse from a
sham siege until the pleasant weeks of autumn were gone, and
then they were to march, with all their guns and ammunition,
south to Vienna, there to fight the French. Frederick, still assuming
that he was the ally of France, was to avail himself of
the excuse that the season of ice and snow was at hand, and
withdraw into winter quarters. Such, in general, were the terms
which Frederick authorized his minister, Goltz, to propose to
Lord Hyndford, as the agent of England and Austria.</p>

<p>Most of our readers will pronounce this to be as unwarrantable
an act of perfidy as history has recorded. But, in justice to
Frederick, we ought to state that there are those who, while admitting
all these facts, do not condemn him for his course. It is
surprising to see how different are the opinions which intelligent
men can form upon the same actions. Mr. Carlyle writes, in reference
to these events:</p>

<p>“Magnanimous I can by no means call Frederick to his allies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
and neighbors, nor even superstitiously veracious in this business;
but he thoroughly understands, he alone, what just thing
he wants out of it, and what an enormous wigged mendacity it
is he has got to deal with. For the rest, he is at the gaming-table
with these sharpers, their dice all cogged, and he knows it,
and ought to profit by his knowledge of it, and, in short, to win
his stake out of that foul, weltering melley, and go home safe
with it if he can.”</p>

<p>While these scenes of war and intrigue were transpiring, no
one knowing what alarming developments any day might present,
Vienna was thrown into a state of terror in apprehension
of the immediate approach of a French army to open upon it all
the horrors of a bombardment. The citizens were called out <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en
masse</i> to work upon the fortifications. The court fled to Presburg,
in Hungary. The national archives were hurried off to
Grätz. The royal family was dispersed. There were but six
thousand troops in the city. General Neipperg, with nearly the
whole Austrian army, was a hundred and fifty miles distant to
the north, on the banks of the Neisse. The queen, on the 10th
of September, assembled at Presburg the Hungarian Parliament,
consisting almost exclusively of chivalric nobles renowned in
war. The queen appeared before them with her husband, the
Grand-duke Francis, by her side, and with a nurse attending,
holding her infant son and heir. Addressing them in Latin, in
a brief, pathetic speech, she said:</p>

<p>“I am abandoned by all. Hostile invasion threatens the
kingdom of Hungary, our person, our children, our crown. I
have no resource but in your fidelity and valor. I invoke the
ancient Hungarian virtue to rise swiftly and save me.”</p>

<p>The queen was radiantly beautiful in form and features. Her
eyes were filled with tears. The scene and the words roused
the zeal of these wild Magyar warriors to the highest pitch.
They drew their sabres, flourished them over their heads, and
with united voice shouted <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Moriamur pro nostro rege, Maria
Theresa</i>—“Let us die for our king, Maria Theresa.” “They always,”
writes Voltaire, “give the title of king to their queen.
In fact, no princess ever better deserved that title.”</p>

    <div class="caption">THE QUEEN’S APPEAL TO THE HUNGARIAN NOBLES.</div></div>

<p>Between the two camps of the Austrians and Prussians, south
of the River Neisse, there was a castle called Little Schnellendorf,
belonging to Count Von Steinberg. It was a very retired
retreat, far from observation. Arrangements were made for a
secret meeting there between Frederick and General Neipperg,
to adjust the details of their plot. It was of the utmost importance
that the perfidious measure should be concealed from France.
The French minister, Valori, was in the Prussian camp, watching
every movement with an eagle eye. “Frederick,” writes Carlyle,
“knows that the French are false to him. He by no means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
intends to be romantically true to them, and that they also
know.”</p>

<p>On Monday morning, the 9th of October, 1741, the British
minister, Lord Hyndford, accompanied by General Neipperg and
General Lentulus from the Austrian camp, repaired to this castle,
ostensibly to fix some cartel for the exchange of prisoners.
Frederick rode out that morning with General Goltz, assuming
that he was going to visit some of his outposts. In leaving, he
said to the French minister Valori, “I am afraid that I shall not
be home to dinner.” At the same time, to occupy the attention
of M. Valori, he was invited to dine with Prince Leopold. By
circuitous and unfrequented paths, the king and his companion
hied to the castle.</p>

<div id="ip_290" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 29.375em;">
  <img src="images/i_290.jpg" width="470" height="348" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">THE KING APPROACHING SCHNELLENDORF.</div></div>

<p>Frederick cautiously refused to sign his name to any paper.
Verbally, he agreed that in one week from that time, on the 16th,
General Neipperg should have liberty to retire to the south
through the mountains, unmolested save by sham attacks in his
rear. A small garrison was to be left in Neisse. After maintaining
a sham siege for a fortnight, they were to surrender the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
city. Sham hostilities, to deceive the French, were to be continued
until the year was out, and then a treaty was to be signed
and ratified.</p>

<p>His majesty pledged his <em>word of honor</em> that he would fulfill
these obligations, but declared that, should the slightest intimation
of the agreement leak out, so that the French should discover
it, he would deny the whole thing, and refuse in any way
to be bound by it. This was assented to.</p>

<p>At the close of the business, the king, who had been exceedingly
courteous during the whole interview, took General Neipperg
aside, and, beckoning Lord Hyndford to join them, said, addressing
Lord Hyndford,</p>

<p>“I wish you too, my lord, to hear every word I speak to General
Neipperg. His Britannic majesty knows, or should know,
my intentions never were to do him hurt, but only to take care
of myself. And pray inform him that I have ordered my army
in Brandenburg to go into winter quarters, and break up that
camp at Göttin.”</p>

<p>The reader will bear in mind that the camp at Göttin, menacing
Hanover, was acting in co-operation with Frederick’s ally,
France, and that forty thousand men had been sent from France
to the aid of those Prussian troops. Frederick now, entering
into secret treaty with the enemy, while still feigning to be true
to his ally, was perfidiously withdrawing his troops so as to leave
the French unsupported. His treachery went even farther than
this. In the presence of Lord Hyndford, the representative of
England, he informed the Austrian general minutely how he
could, to the greatest advantage, attack the French.</p>

<p>“Join,” said he, “the Austrian force under Prince Lobkowitz in
Bohemia. Fall immediately and impetuously upon the French,
before they can combine their forces to resist you. If you succeed
in this, perhaps I will by-and-by join you; if you fail—well,
you know every one must look out for himself.”</p>

<p>The audacious duplicity of this ambitious young king was
still more conspicuously developed by his entering into a secret
correspondence with the court of Austria, through certain generals
in the Austrian army. And that he might the more effectually
disguise his treachery from his allies, the French, he requested
Lord Hyndford to write dispatches to various courts—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>to
Presburg, to England, to Dresden—complaining that Frederick
was <em>deaf to all proposals; that nothing could influence him
to enter into terms of reconciliation with Austria</em>. It was to be
so arranged that the couriers carrying these dispatches of falsehood
should be captured by the French, so that these documents
should be carried to the French court.</p>

<p>And, in addition to all this, the more effectually to hoodwink
the eagle eyes of the French minister in the Prussian camp, M.
Valori, the following stratagem was arranged. The king was
to invite M. Valori to dine with him. While at the table, merry
over their wine, a courier was to arrive, and with trumpet blast
announce dispatches for the king. They were to be delivered
to the king at the table. He was to open them before Valori,
to find that they consisted of a bitter complaint and remonstrance,
on the part of the British minister, that the king was inflexible
in repelling all advances toward an amicable adjustment
of their difficulties, that unrelentingly he persisted in co-operating
with France in her warfare against Austria. All this farce took
place according to the programme. M. Valori was effectually
deceived.</p>

<p>Some of our readers may think that the above narrative is
quite incredible; that a young sovereign, who had just written
the <cite>Anti-Machiavel</cite>, and who knew that the eyes of the world
were upon him, could not be guilty of such perfidy. But, unhappily,
there is no possible room for doubt. The documentary evidence
is ample. There is no contradictory testimony.</p>

<p>General Neipperg, in his account of the interview, writes, in
reference to Frederick: “He is a very spirited young king. He
will not stand contradiction; but a great deal may be made of
him if you seem to adopt his ideas, and honor him in a delicate,
dexterous way. He did not in the least hide his engagements
with France, Bavaria, Saxony. But he would really, so far as I
could judge, prefer friendship with Austria on the given terms.
He seems to have a kind of pique at Saxony, and manifests no
favor for the French and their plans.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carlyle, who, with wonderful accuracy, and with impartiality
which no one will call in question, has recorded the facts
in Frederick’s career, gives the story as it is here told. In the
following terms Mr. Carlyle comments upon these events:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
“Of the political morality of this game of fast-and-loose what
have we to say, except that the dice on both sides seem to be
loaded; that logic might be chopped upon it forever; that a
candid mind will settle what degree of wisdom (which is always
essential veracity) and what of folly (which is always falsity)
there was in Frederick and the others; whether, or to what degree,
there was a better course open to Frederick in the circumstances;
and, in fine, it will have to be granted that you can not
work in pitch and keep hands evidently clean. Frederick has
got into the enchanted wilderness populous with devils and their
work, alas! It will be long before he get out of it again; <em>his</em>
life waning toward night before he get victoriously out, and bequeath
his conquest to luckier successors!”</p>

<p>On the 16th of November General Neipperg broke up his
camp at Neisse, according to the arrangement and, leaving a
small garrison in the city to encounter the sham siege, defiled
through the mountains on the south into Moravia. The Prussians,
pretending to pursue, hung upon his rear for a short distance,
making as much noise and inflicting as little harm as possible.
General Neipperg pressed rapidly on to Vienna, where
he was exultingly welcomed to aid in defending the city menaced
by the French.</p>

<p>Frederick on the 17th, the day after the departure of the Austrian
army, invested Neisse. He had an embarrassing part to
play. He was to conduct a sham siege in the presence of M.
Valori, who was not only a man of ability, but who possessed
much military intelligence. Feigning the utmost zeal, Frederick
opened his trenches, and ostentatiously manœuvred his troops.
He sent the young Prince Leopold, with fifteen thousand horse
and foot, into the Glatz country, many leagues to the east, to
guard against surprise from an enemy, where no enemy was to be
found. He marked out his parallels, sent imperious summonses
for surrender, and dispatched reconnoitring parties abroad. M.
Valori began to be surprised—amazed. “What does all this
mean?” he said to himself. “They have great need of some good
engineers here.”</p>

<p>With that vigilant eye upon him, Frederick was compelled to
some vigor of action. On the night of October 17th he commenced
the bombardment. The noise was terrific. It could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
be prevented but that the shot and shell should do some harm.
Some buildings were burned; several lives were lost. M. Valori,
who knew that the result could not be doubtful, was induced
to go to Breslau and await the surrender. After the garrison
had made apparently a gallant resistance, and Frederick
had achieved apparent prodigies of valor, the city was surrendered
on the 31st of October. Most of the garrison immediately
enlisted in the Prussian service.</p>

<p>Thus the last fortress in Silesia fell into the hands of Frederick.
There was no longer any
foe left in the province to dispute
his acquisition. He took
possession of Neisse on the 1st
of November, celebrating his
victory with illuminations and
all the approved demonstrations
of public rejoicing.</p>

    <div class="caption">MAP OF THE SECOND SILESIAN CAMPAIGN.</div></div>

<p>On the 4th of November he
returned to Breslau, entering
the city with great military
display. Seated in a splendid
carriage, he was drawn through
the streets by eight cream-colored
horses. Taking his seat
upon the ancient ducal throne,
he was crowned, with great
ceremonial pomp, Sovereign Duke of Lower Silesia. Four hundred
of the notables of the dukedom, in gala dresses, and taking
oaths of homage, contributed to the imposing effect of the spectacle.
Illuminations, balls, and popular festivities, in great variety,
closed the triumph.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 9th of November Frederick set out for
Berlin, visiting Glogau by the way. On the 11th he entered
Berlin, where he was received by the whole population with enthusiastic
demonstrations of joy. For a short time he probably
thought that through guile he had triumphed, and that his
troubles were now at an end. But such victories, under the
providence of God, are always of short duration. Frederick
soon found that his troubles had but just begun. He had entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
upon a career of toil, care, and peril, from which he was to
have no escape until he was ready to sink into his grave.</p>

<p>But a few days after his return, Lord Hyndford, who had followed
the king to Berlin, met his majesty in one of the apartments
of the palace. Frederick, struggling to conceal the emotions
with which he was agitated, said to him,</p>

<p>“My lord, the court of Vienna has entirely divulged our secret.
The Dowager Empress has acquainted the court of Bavaria
with it. Wasner, the Austrian minister at Paris, has communicated
it to the French minister, Fleury. The Austrian minister
at St. Petersburg, M. Linzendorf, has told the court of Russia
of it. Sir Thomas Robinson has divulged it to the court of
Dresden. Several members of the British government have
talked about it publicly.”</p>

<p>Frederick immediately and publicly denied that he had ever
entered into any such arrangement with Austria, and declared
the whole story to be a mere fabrication. Having by the stratagem
obtained Neisse, and delivered Silesia from the presence of
the Austrian army, he assured the French of his unchanging fidelity
to their interests, and with renewed vigor commenced co-operating
with them in the furtherance of some new ambitious
plans.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">It</span> was on the 11th of November, 1741, that Frederick, elated
with his conquest of Silesia, had returned to Berlin. In commencing
the enterprise he had said, “Ambition, interest, and the
desire to make the world speak of me, vanquished all, and war
was determined on.” He had, indeed, succeeded in making the
“world speak” of him. He had suddenly become the most
prominent man in Europe. Some extolled his exploits. Some
expressed amazement at his perfidy. Many, recognizing his sagacity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
and his tremendous energy, sought his alliance. Embassadors
from the various courts of Europe crowded his capital.
Fourteen sovereign princes, with many foreigners of the highest
rank, were counted among the number. The king was in high
spirits. While studiously maturing his plans for the future, he
assumed the air of a thoughtless man of fashion, and dazzled the
eyes and bewildered the minds of his guests with feasts and pageants.</p>

<div id="ip_296" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 26.1875em;">
  <img src="images/i_296.jpg" width="419" height="508" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">FREDERICK THE GREAT. ÆT. 30</div></div>

<p>On the 7th of January, 1742, Frederick’s eldest brother, William
Augustus, was married to Louisa Amelia, a younger sister
of the king’s neglected wife, Elizabeth. The king himself graced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
the festival, in gorgeous attire, and very successfully plied all his
wonderful arts of fascination. “He appeared,” says Bielfeld, “so
young, so gay, so graceful, that I could not have refrained from
loving him, even if he had been a stranger.”</p>

<p>But, in the midst of these scenes of gayety, the king was contemplating
the most complicated combinations of diplomacy.
Europe was apparently thrown into a state of chaos. It was
Frederick’s one predominant thought to see what advantages he
could secure to Prussia from the general wreck and ruin. Lord
Macaulay, speaking of these scenes, says:</p>

<p>“The selfish rapacity of the King of Prussia gave the signal
to his neighbors. His example quieted their sense of shame.
The whole world sprang to arms. On the head of Frederick is
all the blood which was shed in a war which raged during many
years, and in every quarter of the globe—the blood of the column
of Fontenoy, the blood of the brave mountaineers who were
slaughtered at Culloden. The evils produced by this wickedness
were felt in lands where the name of Prussia was unknown.
In order that he might rob a neighbor whom he had promised
to defend, black men fought on the coast of Coromandel, and red
men scalped each other by the great lakes of North America.”</p>

<p>As we have stated, Frederick had declared that if any rumor
should be spread abroad of the fact that he had entered into a
secret treaty with Austria, he would deny it, and would no longer
pay any regard to its stipulations. He had adopted the precaution
not to affix his signature to any paper. By this ignoble
stratagem he had obtained Neisse and Silesia. The rumor of
the secret treaty had gone abroad. He had denied it. And
now, in accordance with the principles of his peculiar code of
honor, he felt himself at liberty to pursue any course which policy
might dictate.</p>

<p>Frederick, in his <cite>Histoire de mon Temps</cite>, states that, in the negotiations
which at this time took place in Berlin, France pressed
the king to bring forward his armies into vigorous co-operation;
that England exhorted him to make peace with Austria;
that Spain solicited his alliance in her warfare against England;
that Denmark implored his counsel as to the course it was wise
for that kingdom to pursue; that Sweden entreated his aid
against Russia; that Russia besought his good offices to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
peace with the court at Stockholm; and that the German empire,
anxious for peace, entreated him to put an end to those
troubles which were convulsing all Europe.</p>

<p>The probable object of the Austrian court in revealing the secret
treaty of Schnellendorf was to set Frederick and France at
variance. Frederick, much exasperated, not only denied the
treaty, but professed increased devotion to the interests of Louis
XV. The allies, consisting of France, Prussia, Bavaria, and Saxony,
now combined to wrest Moravia from Maria Theresa, and
annex it to Saxony. This province, governed by a marquis, was
a third larger than the State of Massachusetts, and contained a
population of about a million and a half. Moravia bounded Silesia
on the south. Frederick made a special treaty with the
King of Saxony, that the southern boundary of Silesia should
be a full German mile, which was between four and five English
miles, beyond the line of the River Neisse. With Frederick’s
usual promptitude, he insisted that commissioners should be immediately
sent to put down the boundary stones. France was
surprised that the King of Saxony should have consented to the
surrender of so important a strip of his territory.</p>

<p>Frederick paid but little regard to his allies save as he could
make them subservient to the accomplishment of his purposes.
He pushed his troops forward many leagues south into Moravia,
and occupied the important posts of Troppau, Friedenthal, and
Olmütz. These places were seized the latter part of December.
The king hoped thus to be able, early in the spring, to carry the
war to the gates of Vienna.</p>

<p>On the 18th of January, 1742, Frederick visited Dresden, to
confer with Augustus III., King of Poland, who was also Elector
of Saxony, and whose realms were to be increased by the
annexation of Moravia. His Polish majesty was a weak man,
entirely devoted to pleasure. His irresolute mind, subjected to
the dominant energies of the Prussian king, was as clay in the
hands of the potter.</p>

<p>“You are now,” said Frederick, “by consent of the allies, King
of Moravia. Now is the time, now or never, to become so in
fact. Push forward your Saxon troops. The Austrian forces
are weak in that country. At Iglau, just over the border from
Austria, there is a large magazine of military stores, which can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
easily be seized. Urge forward your troops. The French will
contribute strong divisions. I will join you with twenty thousand
men. We can at once take possession of Moravia, and perhaps
march directly on to Vienna.”</p>

<p>Frederick, in describing this interview, writes: “Augustus answered
<em>yes</em> to every thing, with an air of being convinced, joined
to a look of great <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ennui</i>. Count Brühl,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> whom this interview
displeased, interrupted it by announcing to his majesty that the
Opera was about to commence. Ten kingdoms to conquer would
not have kept the King of Poland a minute longer. He went,
therefore, to the Opera; and the King of Prussia obtained at
once, in spite of those who opposed it, a final decision.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>The next morning, in the intense cold of midwinter, Frederick
set out several hours before daylight for the city of Prague,
which the French and Bavarians had captured on the 25th of
November. Declining all polite attentions, for business was urgent,
he eagerly sought M. De Séchelles, the renowned head of
the commissariat department, and made arrangements with him
to perform the extremely difficult task of supplying the army
with food in a winter’s campaign.</p>

<p>The next morning, at an early hour, he again dashed off to the
east, toward Glatz, a hundred miles distant, where a portion of
the Prussian troops were in cantonments, under the young Prince
Leopold. Within a week he had ridden over seven hundred
miles, commencing his journey every morning as early as four
o’clock, and doing a vast amount of business by the way.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that, in the note which M. Valori accidentally
dropped, and which Frederick furtively obtained, the
minister was instructed by the French court not to give up Glatz
to the Prussian king if he could possibly avoid it. But Frederick
had now seized the city, and the region around, by force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
of arms, and held them with a gripe not to be relaxed. Glatz
was a Catholic town. In the convent there was an image of the
Virgin, whose tawdry robes had become threadbare and faded.
The wife of the Austrian commandant had promised the Virgin
a new dress if she would keep the Prussians out of the city.
Frederick heard of this. As he took possession of the city, with
grim humor he assured the Virgin that she should not lose in
consequence of the favor she had shown the Prussians. New
and costly garments were immediately provided for her at the
expense of the Prussian king.</p>

<p>On the 26th of January Frederick set out from Glatz, with a
strong cortége, for Olmütz, far away to the southeast. This place
his troops had occupied for a month past. His route led through
a chain of mountains, whose bleak and dreary defiles were clogged
with drifted snow, and swept by freezing gales. It was a
dreadful march, accompanied by many disasters and much suffering.</p>

<p>General Stille, one of the aids of Frederick on this expedition,
says that the king, with his retinue, mounted and in carriages,
pushed forward the first day to Landskron. “It was,” he writes,
“such a march as I never witnessed before. Through the ice
and through the snow, which covered that dreadful chain of
mountains between Böhmen and Mähren, we did not arrive till
very late. Many of our carriages were broken down, and others
were overturned more than once.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>Frederick, ever regardless of fatigue and exposure for himself,
never spared his followers. It was after midnight of the 28th
when the weary column, frostbitten, hungry, and exhausted,
reached Olmütz. The king was hospitably entertained in the
fine palace of the Catholic bishop, “a little, gouty man,” writes
Stille, “about fifty-two years of age, with a countenance open
and full of candor.”</p>

<p>Orders had been issued for all the Prussian troops to be rendezvoused
by the 5th of February at Wischau. They were then
to march immediately about seventy-five miles west, to Trebitsch,
which was but a few miles south of Iglau, the point of attack.
Here they were to join the French and Saxon troops. The force
thus concentrated would amount to twenty-four thousand Prussian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
troops, twenty thousand Saxons, and five thousand French
horsemen. With this army—forty-nine thousand strong—Frederick
was to advance, by one short day’s march, upon Iglau,
where the Austrian garrison amounted to but ten thousand men.</p>

<p>In the mean time, on the 24th of January, Charles Albert,
King of Bavaria, through the intrigues of the French minister
and the diplomacy of Frederick, was chosen Emperor of Germany.
This election Frederick regarded as a great triumph on
his part. It was the signal defeat of Austria. Very few of
the sons of Adam have passed a more joyless and dreary earthly
pilgrimage than was the fortune of Charles Albert. At the
time of his election he was forty-five years of age, of moderate
stature, polished manners, and merely ordinary abilities. He
was suffering from a complication of the most painful disorders.
His previous life had been but a series of misfortunes, and during
all the rest of his days he was assailed by the storms of adversity.
In death alone he found refuge from a life almost without
a joy.</p>

<p>Charles Albert, who took the title of “the Emperor Charles
VII.,” was the son of Maximilian, King of Bavaria, who was
ruined at Blenheim, and who, being placed under the ban of the
empire, lived for many years a pensioner upon the charity of
Louis XIV. Charles was then but seven years of age, a prince
by birth, yet homeless, friendless, and in poverty. With varying
fortunes, he subsequently married a daughter of the Emperor
Joseph. She was a cousin of Maria Theresa. Upon the death
of his father in 1726, Charles Albert became King of Bavaria;
but he was involved in debt beyond all hope of extrication. The
intrigues of Frederick placed upon his wan and wasted brow
the imperial crown of Germany. The coronation festivities took
place at Frankfort, with great splendor, on the 12th of February,
1742.</p>

<p>Wilhelmina, who was present, gives a graphic account, with
her vivacious pen, of many of the scenes, both tragic and comic,
which ensued.</p>

<p>“Of the coronation itself,” she writes, “though it was truly
grand, I will say nothing. The poor emperor could not enjoy it
much. He was dying of gout and other painful diseases, and
could scarcely stand upon his feet. He spends most of his time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
in bed, courting all manner of German princes. He has managed
to lead my margraf into a foolish bargain about raising
men for him, which bargain I, on fairly getting sight of it, persuade
my margraf to back out of; and, in the end, he does so.
The emperor had fallen so ill he was considered even in danger
of his life. Poor prince! What a lot he had achieved for himself!”</p>

<p>While these coronation splendors were transpiring, Frederick
was striving, with all his characteristic enthusiasm, to push forward
his Moravian campaign to a successful issue. Inspired by
as tireless energies as ever roused a human heart, he was annoyed
beyond measure by the want of efficient co-operation on the
part of his less zealous allies. Neither the Saxons nor the French
could keep pace with his impetuosity. The princes who led the
Saxon troops, the petted sons of kings and nobles, were loth to
abandon the luxurious indulgences to which they had been accustomed.
When they arrived at a capacious castle where they
found warm fires, an abundant larder, and sparkling wines, they
would linger there many days, decidedly preferring those comforts
to campaigning through the blinding, smothering snowstorm,
and bivouacking on the bleak and icy plains, swept by
the gales of a northern winter. The French were equally averse
to these terrible marches, far more to be dreaded than the battle-field.</p>

<p>Frederick remonstrated, argued, implored, but all in vain.
He was not disposed to allow considerations of humanity, regard
for suffering or life, to stand in the way of his ambitious plans.
For two months, from February 5th, when Frederick rendezvoused
the Prussians at Wischau, until April 5th, he found himself,
to his excessive chagrin, unable to accomplish any thing of
moment, in consequence of the lukewarmness of his allies. He
was annoyed almost beyond endurance. It was indeed important,
in a military point of view, that there should be an immediate
march upon Iglau. It was certain that the Austrians, forewarned,
would soon remove their magazines or destroy them. The
utmost expedition was essential to the success of the enterprise.</p>

<p>The young officers in the Saxon army, having disposed their
troops in comfortable barracks, had established their own head-quarters
in the magnificent castle of Budischau, in the vicinity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
of Trebitsch. “Nothing like this superb mansion,” writes Stille,
“is to be seen except in theatres, on the drop-scene of the enchanted
castle.” Here these young lords made themselves very
comfortable. They had food in abundance, luxuriously served,
with the choicest wines. Roaring fires in huge stoves converted,
within the walls, winter into genial summer. Here these
pleasure-loving nobles, with song, and wine, and such favorites,
male and female, as they carried with them, loved to linger.</p>

<div id="ip_303" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27.5625em;">
  <img src="images/i_303.jpg" width="441" height="493" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">THE YOUNG LORDS OF SAXONY ON A WINTER CAMPAIGN.</div></div>

<p>At length, however, Frederick succeeded in pushing forward
a detachment of his army to seize the magazines and the post he
so greatly coveted. The troops marched all night. Toward
morning, almost perishing with cold, they built enormous fires.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
Having warmed their numbed and freezing limbs, they pressed
on to Iglau, to find it abandoned by the garrison. The Austrian
general Lobkowitz had carried away every thing which could
be removed, and then had reduced to ashes seventeen magazines,
filled with military and commissary stores. The king was exceedingly
chagrined by this barren conquest. He was anxious
to advance in all directions, to take full possession of Moravia,
before the Austrians could send re-enforcements to garrison its
fortresses; but the Saxon lords refused to march any farther in
this severe winter campaign. Frederick complained to the Saxon
king. His Polish majesty sent an angry order to his troops
to go forward. Sullenly they obeyed, interposing every obstacle
in their power. Some of the leaders threw up their commissions
and went home. Frederick, with his impetuous Prussians and
his unwilling Saxons, spread over Moravia, levying contributions
and seizing the strong places.</p>

<p>The Saxons, much irritated, were rather more disposed to
thwart his plans than to co-operate in them. The Austrian
horsemen were vigilant, pouncing upon every unprotected detachment.
Frederick marched for the capture of Brünn, the
strongest fortress in Moravia. It had a garrison of seven thousand
men, under the valiant leader Roth. To arrest the march
of Frederick, and leave him shelterless on the plains, the Austrian
general laid sixteen villages in ashes. The poor peasants—men,
women, and children—foodless and shelterless, were thus
cast loose upon the drifted fields. Who can gauge such woes?</p>

<p>Frederick, finding that he could not rely upon the Saxons, sent
to Silesia for re-enforcements of his own troops. Brünn could
not be taken without siege artillery. He was capturing Moravia
for the King of Poland. Frederick dispatched a courier to
his Polish majesty at Dresden, requesting him immediately to
forward the siege guns. The reply of the king, who was voluptuously
lounging in his palaces, was, “I can not meet the expense
of the carriage.” Frederick contemptuously remarked, “He has
just purchased a green diamond which would have carried them
thither and back again.” The Prussian king sent for siege artillery
of his own, drew his lines close around Brünn, and urged
Chevalier De Saxe, general of the Saxon horse, to co-operate
with him energetically in battering the city into a surrender.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
The chevalier interposed one obstacle, and another, and another.
At last he replied, showing his dispatches, “I have orders to retire
from this business altogether, and join the French at Prague.”</p>

<p>Frederick declares, in his history, that never were tidings more
welcome to him than these. He had embarked in the enterprise
for the conquest of Moravia with the allies. He could not, without
humiliation, withdraw. But, now that the ally, in whose behalf
he assumed to be fighting, had abandoned him, he could,
without dishonor, relinquish the field. Leaving the Saxons to
themselves, with many bitter words of reproach, he countermanded
his order for Silesian re-enforcements, assembled his troops at
Wischau, and then, by a rapid march through Olmütz, returned
to his strong fortresses in the north.</p>

<p>The Saxons were compelled to a precipitate retreat. Their
march was long, harassing, and full of suffering, from the severe
cold of those latitudes, and from the assaults of the fierce Pandours,
every where swarming around. Villages were burned,
and maddened men wreaked direful vengeance on each other.
Scarcely eight thousand of their number, a frostbitten, starving,
emaciate band, reached the borders of Saxony. Curses loud and
deep were heaped upon the name of Frederick. His Polish majesty,
though naturally good-natured, was greatly exasperated in
view of the conduct of the Prussian king in forcing the troops
into the severities of such a campaign. Frederick himself was
also equally indignant with Augustus for his want of co-operation.
The French minister, Valori, met him on his return from
these disasters. He says that his look was ferocious and dark;
that his laugh was bitter and sardonic; that a vein of suppressed
rage, mockery, and contempt pervaded every word he uttered.</p>

<p>Frederick withdrew his troops into strong cantonments in the
valley of the upper Elbe. This beautiful river takes its rise in
romantic chasms, among the ridges and spurs of the Giant Mountains,
on the southeastern borders of Silesia. Here the Prussian
army was distributed in small towns along a line following the
windings of the stream, about forty miles in length. All the
troops could be concentrated in forty-eight hours. The encampments
faced the south, with the Elbe behind them. At some
little distance north of the river, safe from surprise, the magazines
were stationed. The mountains of Bohemia rose sublimely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
in the distant background. In a letter to M. Jordan, under
date of Chrudim, May 5th, 1742, Frederick expresses his views
of this profitless campaign in the following terms:</p>

  <img src="images/i_306.jpg" width="553" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">MAP ILLUSTRATING THE CAMPAIGN IN MORAVIA.</div></div>

<p>“Moravia, which is a very bad country, could not be held, owing
to want of provisions. The town of Brünn could not be
taken because the Saxons had no cannon. When you wish to
enter a town, you must first make a hole to get in by. Besides,
the country has been reduced to such a state that the enemy can
not subsist in it, and you will soon see him leave it. There is
your little military lesson. I would not have you at a loss what
to think of our operations, or what to say, should other people
talk of them in your presence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
Elsewhere, Frederick, speaking of these two winter campaigns,
says: “Winter campaigns are bad, and should always be avoided,
except in cases of necessity. The best army in the world is
liable to be ruined by them. I myself have made more winter
campaigns than any general of this age. But there were reasons.
In 1740 there were hardly above two Austrian regiments in Silesia,
at the death of the Emperor Charles VI. Being determined
to assert my right to that duchy, I had to try it at once,
in winter, and carry the war, if possible, to the banks of the
Neisse. Had I waited till spring, we must have begun the war
between Crossen and Glogau. What was now to be gained by
one march would then have cost us three or four campaigns. A
sufficient reason, this, for campaigning in winter. If I did not
succeed in the winter campaigns of 1742, a campaign which I
made to deliver Moravia, then overrun by Austrians, it was because
the French acted like fools, and the Saxons like traitors.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>Frederick, establishing his head-quarters at Chrudim, did not
suppose the Austrians would think of moving upon him until
the middle of June. Not till then would the grass in that cold
region afford forage. But Maria Theresa was inspired by energies
fully equal to those of her renowned assailant. Undismayed
by the powerful coalition against her, she sent Prince Charles,
her brother-in-law, early in May, at the head of an army thirty
thousand strong, to advance by a secret, rapid flank march, and
seize the Prussian magazines beyond the Elbe.</p>

<p>The ever-wakeful eye of Frederick detected the movement.
His beautiful encampment at Chrudim had lasted but two days.
Instantly couriers were dispatched in all directions to rendezvous
the Prussian troops on a vast plain in the vicinity of Chrudim.
But a few hours elapsed ere every available man in the Prussian
ranks was on the march. This movement rendered it necessary
for Prince Charles to concentrate the Austrian army also. The
field upon which these hosts were gathering for battle was an
undulating prairie, almost treeless, with here and there a few
hamlets of clustered peasant cottages scattered around.</p>

    <div class="caption">FREDERICK CONCENTRATING HIS ARMY AT CHRUDIM.</div></div>

<p>It was a serene, cloudless May morning when Frederick rode
upon a small eminence to view the approach of his troops, and
to form them in battle array. General Stille, who was an eye-witness
of the scene, describes the spectacle as one of the most
beautiful and magnificent which was ever beheld. The transparent
atmosphere, the balmy air, transmitting with wonderful
accuracy the most distant sounds, the smooth, wide-spreading
prairie, the hamlets, to which distance lent enchantment, surmounted
by the towers or spires of the churches, the winding
columns of infantry and cavalry, their polished weapons flashing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
in the sunlight, the waving of silken and gilded banners, while
bugle peals and bursts of military airs floated now faintly, and
now loudly, upon the ear, the whole scene being bathed in the
rays of the most brilliant of spring mornings—all together presented
war in its brightest hues, divested of every thing revolting.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>There were nearly thirty thousand men, infantry and cavalry,
thus assembling under the banners of Frederick for battle. They
were in as perfect state of drill as troops have ever attained, and
were armed with the most potent implements of war which that
age could furnish. The king was visibly affected by the spectacle.
Whether humane considerations touched his heart, or
merely poetic emotion moved him, we can not tell. But he was
well aware that within a few hours not merely hundreds, but
thousands of those men, torn by shot and shell, would be prostrate
in their blood upon the plain; and he could not but know
that for all the carnage and the suffering, he, above all others,
would be responsible at the bar of God.</p>

<p>“The king,” writes Stille, “though fatigued, would not rest
satisfied with reports or distant view. Personally he made the
tour of the whole camp, to see that every thing was right, and
posted the pickets himself before retiring.”</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">It</span> was the aim of Prince Charles to get between Frederick’s
encampment at Chrudim and his French allies, under Marshal
Broglio, at Prague. When discovered by Frederick, the Austrian
army was on the rapid march along a line about fifteen
miles nearly southwest of Chrudim. It thus threatened to cut
Frederick’s communication with Prague, which was on the Moldau,
about sixty miles west of the Prussian encampment. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
forces now gathering for a decisive battle were nearly equal.
The reader would not be interested in the description of the
strategic and tactical movements of the next two days. The
leaders of both parties, with great military sagacity, were accumulating
and concentrating their forces for a conflict, which, under
the circumstances, would doubtless prove ruinous to the one
or the other. A battle upon that open plain, with equal forces,
was of the nature of a duel, in which one or the other of the combatants
must fall.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 17th of May Frederick’s army was
drawn out in battle array, facing south, near the village of Chotusitz,
about fifteen miles west of Chrudim. Almost within cannon-shot
of him, upon the same plain, near the village of Czaslau,
facing north, was the army of Prince Charles. The field was
like a rolling western prairie, with one or two sluggish streams
running through it; and here and there marshes, which neither
infantry nor cavalry could traverse. The accompanying map will
give the reader an idea of the nature of the ground and the position
of the hostile forces.</p>

<p>The sun rose clear and cloudless over the plain, soon to be
crimsoned with blood and darkened by the smoke of battle.
The Prussians took position in accordance with very minute directions
given to the young Prince Leopold by Frederick. It
was manifest to the most unskilled observer that the storm of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
battle would rage over many miles, as the infantry charged to
and fro; as squadrons of strongly-mounted cavalry swept the
field; as bullets, balls, and shells were hurled in all directions
from the potent enginery of war.</p>

<p>About seven o’clock in the morning the king ascended an eminence,
and carefully scanned the field, where sixty thousand men
were facing each other, soon to engage in mutual slaughter.
There were two spectacles which arrested his attention. The
one was the pomp, and pageantry, and panoply of war, with its
serried ranks, its prancing steeds, its flashing armor, its waving
banners, its inspiriting bugle-peals—a scene in itself beautiful
and sublime in the highest conceivable degree.</p>

<p>But there was another picture which met the eye of the king
very different in its aspect. We know not whether it at all
touched his heart. It was that of the poor peasants, with their
mothers, their wives, their children, hurrying from their hamlets
in all directions, in the utmost dismay. Grandmothers tottered
beneath the burden of infant children. Fathers and mothers
struggled on with the household goods they were striving to rescue
from impending ruin. The cry of maidens and children
reached the ear as they fled from the tramp of the war-horse and
the approaching carnage of the death-dealing artillery.</p>

<p>Frederick, having carefully scanned the Austrian lines for an
instant or two, gave the signal, and all his batteries opened their
thunders. Under cover of that storm of iron, several thousand
of the cavalry, led by the veteran General Bredow, deployed from
behind some eminences, and first at a gentle trot, and then upon
the most impetuous run, with flashing sabres, hurled themselves
upon the left wing of the Austrian lines. The ground was dry
and sandy, and a prodigious cloud of dust enveloped them. For
a moment the tornado, vital with human energies, swept on, apparently
unobstructed. The first line of the Austrian horse was
met, crushed, annihilated. But the second stood as the rock
breasts the waves, horse against horse, rider against rider, sabre
against sabre. Nothing met the eye but one vast eddying whirlpool
of dust, as if writhing in volcanic energies, while here and
there the flash of fire and the gleam of steel flickered madly
through it.</p>

<p>The battle, thus commenced, continued to rage for four long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
hours, with all its demon energies, its blood, its wounds, its oaths,
its shrieks, its death; on the right wing, on the left wing, in the
centre; till some ten or twelve thousand, some accounts say more,
of these poor peasant soldiers lay prostrate upon the plain, crushed
by the hoof, torn by the bullet, gashed by the sabre. Many
were dead. Many were dying. Many had received wounds
which would cripple them until they should totter into their
graves. At the close of these four hours of almost superhuman
effort, the villages all around in flames, the Austrians slowly,
sullenly retired from the contest. Prince Charles, having lost
nearly seven thousand men, with his remaining forces breathless,
exhausted, bleeding, retired through Czaslau, and vanished over
the horizon to the southwest. Frederick, with his forces almost
equally breathless, exhausted, and bleeding, and counting five
thousand of his soldiers strewn over the plain, in death or
wounds, remained master of the field. Such was the famous battle
of Chotusitz.</p>

<p>In the following terms, Frederick, the moment the battle was
over, announced his victory, not to his wife, but to his friend
Jordan:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
“From the Field of Battle of Chotusitz, May 17, 1742.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Jordan</span>,—I must tell you, as gayly as I can, that we
have beaten the enemy soundly, and that we are all pretty well
after it. Poor Rothenburg is wounded in the breast and in the
arm, but, as it is hoped, without danger. Adieu. You will be
happy, I think, at the good news I send you. My compliments
to Cæsarion.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Frederick did not pursue the Austrians after this victory.
Nine acres of ground were required to bury the dead. He rented
this land from the proprietor for twenty-five years. His alienation
from his allies was such that, without regard to them, he
was disposed to make peace with Austria upon the best terms
he could for himself. England also, alarmed in view of the increasing
supremacy of France, was so anxious to detach Frederick,
with his invincible troops, from the French alliance, that the
British cabinet urged Maria Theresa to make any sacrifice whatever
that might be necessary to secure peace with Prussia. Frederick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
influenced by such considerations, buried the illustrious
Austrian dead with the highest marks of military honor, and
treated with marked consideration his distinguished prisoners
of war.</p>

<p>Secret negotiations were immediately opened at Breslau, in
Silesia, between England, Austria, and Prussia. Maria Theresa,
harassed by the entreaties of her cabinet and by the importunities
of the British court, consented to all that Frederick demanded.</p>

<p>The French, who, through their shrewd embassador, kept
themselves informed of all that was transpiring, were quite
alarmed in view of the approaching accommodation between
Prussia and Austria. It is said that Frederick, on the 6th of
June, in reply to the earnest remonstrances of the French minister,
Marshal Belleisle, against his withdrawal from the alliance,
frankly said to him,</p>

<p>“All that I ever wanted, more than I ever demanded, Austria
now offers me. Can any one blame me that I close such an alliance
as ours all along has been, when such terms are presented
to me as Austria now proposes?”</p>

<p>On the 15th of June Frederick gave a grand dinner to his
generals at his head-quarters. In an after-dinner speech he said
to them,</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I announce to you that, as I never wished to oppress
the Queen of Hungary, I have formed the resolution of
agreeing with that princess, and accepting the proposals she has
made me, in satisfaction of my rights.”</p>

<p>Toasts were then drank with great enthusiasm to the health
of “Maria Theresa, Queen of Hungary,” to “the queen’s consort,
Francis, Grand-duke of Lorraine;” and universal and cordial was
the response of applause when the toast was proposed “to the
brave Prince Charles.”</p>

<p>The treaty of Breslau was signed on the 11th of June, and
ratified at Berlin on the 28th of July. By this treaty, Silesia,
Lower and Upper, was ceded to “Frederick and his heirs for evermore,”
while Frederick withdrew from the French alliance, and
entered into friendly relations with her Hungarian majesty. Immediately
after the settlement of this question, Frederick, cantoning
his troops in Silesia, returned to Berlin. Elate with victory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
and accompanied by a magnificent suite, the young conqueror
hastened home, over green fields and beneath a summer’s sun.
Keenly he enjoyed his triumph, greeted with the enthusiastic acclaim
of the people in all the towns and villages through which
he passed.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> At Frankfort-on-the-Oder, where a fair was in operation,
the king stopped for a few hours. Vast crowds, which had
been drawn to the place by the fair, lined the highway for a long
distance on both sides, eager to see the victor who had aggrandized
Prussia by adding a large province to its realms.</p>

<p>“His majesty’s entrance into Frankfort,” writes M. Bielfeld,
who accompanied him, “although very triumphant, was far from
ostentatious. We passed like lightning before the eyes of the
spectators, and were so covered with dust that it was difficult to
distinguish the color of our coats and the features of our faces.
We made some purchases at Frankfort, and the next day arrived
safely in Berlin, where the king was received with the acclamations
of his people.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>If we can rely upon the testimony of Frederick, an incident
occurred at this time which showed that the French court was
as intriguing and unprincipled as was his Prussian majesty. It
is quite evident that the Austrian court also was not animated
by a very high sense of honor.</p>

<p>After the battle of Chotusitz, Frederick called upon General
Pallant, an Austrian officer, who was wounded and a prisoner.
In the course of the conversation, General Pallant stated that
France was ready at any moment to betray his Prussian majesty,
and that, if he would give him six days’ time, he would furnish
him with documentary proof. A courier was instantly dispatched
to Vienna. He soon returned with a letter from Cardinal
Fleury, the prime minister of Louis XV., addressed to Maria
Theresa, informing her that, if she would give up Bohemia to
the emperor, France would <em>guarantee to her Silesia</em>. Frederick,
though guilty of precisely the same treachery himself, read the
document with indignation, and assumed to be as much amazed
at the perfidy as he could have been had he been an honest man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
“The cardinal,” he said, “takes me for a fool. He wishes to
betray me. I will try and prevent him.”</p>

<p>The French marshal, Belleisle, alarmed by the report that
Frederick was entering into a treaty of peace with Austria,
hastened to the Prussian camp to ascertain the truth or falsehood
of the rumor. Frederick, emboldened by the document he
had in his pocket, was very frank.</p>

<p>“I have prescribed,” he said, “the conditions of peace to the
Queen of Hungary. She accepts them. Having, therefore, all
that I want, I make peace. All the world in my situation would
do the same.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible, sire,” Marshal Belleisle replied, “that you can
dare to abandon the best of your allies, and to deceive so illustrious
a monarch as the King of France?”</p>

<p>“And you, sir,” responded the king, with an air of great disdain,
at the same time placing in his hand the cardinal’s letter,
“do you dare to talk to me in this manner?”</p>

<p>The marshal glanced his eye over the document, and retired,
overwhelmed with confusion. Thus ended the alliance between
Prussia and France. “Each party,” writes Frederick, “wished
to be more cunning than the other.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>In the following terms, Frederick correctly sums up the incidents
of the two Silesian campaigns:</p>

<p>“Thus was Silesia reunited to the dominions of Prussia. Two
years of war sufficed for the conquest of this important province.
The treasure which the late king had left was nearly exhausted.
But it is a cheap purchase, where whole provinces are bought
for seven or eight millions of crowns. The union of circumstances
at the moment peculiarly favored this enterprise. It
was necessary for it that France should allow itself to be drawn
into the war; that Russia should be attacked by Sweden; that,
from timidity, the Hanoverians and Saxons should remain inactive;
that the successes of the Prussians should be uninterrupted;
and that the King of England, the enemy of Prussia, should
become, in spite of himself, the instrument of its aggrandizement.
What, however, contributed the most to this conquest was an
army which had been formed for twenty-two years, by means of
a discipline admirable in itself, and superior to the troops of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
rest of Europe. Generals, also, who were true patriots, wise and
incorruptible ministers, and, finally, a certain good fortune which
often accompanies youth, and often deserts a more advanced
age.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>There was no end to the panegyrics which Voltaire, in his
correspondence with Frederick, now lavished upon him. He
greeted him with the title of Frederick the Great.</p>

<p>“How glorious,” he exclaimed, “is my king, the youngest of
kings, and the grandest! A king who carries in the one hand
an all-conquering sword, but in the other a blessed olive-branch,
and is the arbiter of Europe for peace or war.”</p>

<p>Frederick, having obtained all that, for the present, he could
hope to obtain, deemed it for his interest to attempt to promote
the peace of Europe. His realms needed consolidating, his army
recruiting, his treasury replenishing. But he found it much easier
to stir up the elements of strife than to allay them.</p>

<p>His withdrawal from the French alliance removed the menace
from the English Hanoverian possession. George II. eagerly
sent an army of sixty thousand men to the aid of Maria Theresa
against France, and freely opened to her his purse. The French
were defeated every where. They were driven from Prague in
one of the most disastrous wintry retreats of blood and misery
over which the demon of war ever gloated. The powerless, penniless
emperor, the creature of France, who had neither purse
nor army, was driven, a fugitive and a vagabond, from his petty
realm of Bavaria, and was exposed to humiliation, want, and insult.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa was developing character which attracted the
admiration of Europe. She seriously contemplated taking command
of her armies herself. She loved Duke Francis, her husband,
treated him very tenderly, and was anxious to confer upon
him honor; but by nature vastly his superior, instinctively she
assumed the command. She led; he followed. She was a magnificent
rider. Her form was the perfection of grace. Her beautiful,
pensive, thoughtful face was tanned by the weather. All
hearts throbbed as, on a spirited charger, she sometimes swept
before the ranks of the army, with her gorgeous retinue, appearing
and disappearing like a meteor. She was as devout as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
was brave, winning the homage of all Catholic hearts. We
know not where, in the long list of sovereigns, to point to man
or woman of more imperial energies, of more exalted worth.</p>

<div id="ip_317" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.6875em;">
  <img src="images/i_317.jpg" width="459" height="593" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">MARIA THERESA AT THE HEAD OF HER ARMY.</div></div>

<p>The loss of Silesia she regarded as an act of pure highway
robbery. It rankled in her noble heart as the great humiliation
and disgrace of her reign. Frederick was to her but as a hated
and successful bandit, who had wrenched from her crown one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
its brightest jewels. To the last day of her life she never ceased
to deplore the loss. It is said that if any stranger, obtaining an
audience, was announced as from Silesia, the eyes of the queen
would instantly flood with tears. But the fortunes of war had
now triumphantly turned in her favor. Aided by the armies
and the gold of England, she was on the high career of conquest.
Her troops had overrun Bohemia and Bavaria. She was disposed
to hold those territories in compensation for Silesia, which
she had lost.</p>

<p>In the mean time, during the two years in which Maria Theresa
was making these conquests, Frederick, alarmed by the aggrandizement
of Austria and the weakening of France, while unavailingly
striving to promote peace, was busily employed in the
administration of his internal affairs. He encouraged letters;
devoted much attention to the Academy of Arts and Sciences;
reared the most beautiful opera-house in Europe; devoted large
sums to secure the finest musicians and the most exquisite ballet-dancers
which Europe could afford. He sought to make his
capital attractive to all those throughout Europe who were inspired
by a thirst for knowledge, or who were in the pursuit of
pleasure.</p>

<p>One incident in this connection, illustrative of the man and
of the times, merits brief notice. His agent at Venice reported
a female dancer there of rare attainments, Señora Barberina.
She was marvelously beautiful, and a perfect fairy in figure and
grace, and as fascinating in her vivacity and sparkling intelligence
as she was lovely in person. Frederick immediately ordered
her to be engaged for his opera-house at Berlin, at a salary
of nearly four thousand dollars, and sundry perquisites.</p>

<p>But it so happened that the beautiful dancer had in the train
of her impassioned admirers a young English gentleman, a
younger brother of the Earl of Bute. He was opposed to Barberina’s
going to Prussia, and induced her to throw up the engagement.
Frederick was angry, and demanded the execution
of the contract. The pretty Barberina, safe in Venice, made herself
merry with the complaints of the Prussian monarch. Frederick,
not accustomed to be thwarted, applied to the doge and
the Senate of Venice to compel Barberina to fulfill her contract.
They replied with great politeness, but did nothing. Barberina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
remained with her lover under the sunny skies of Italy, charming
with her graceful pirouettes admiring audiences in the Venetian
theatres.</p>

<p>In the mean time a Venetian embassador, on his way to one
of the northern courts, passed a night at a hotel in Berlin. He
was immediately arrested, with his luggage, by a royal order.
A dispatch was transmitted to Venice, stating that the embassador
would be held as a hostage till Barberina was sent to Prussia.
“A bargain,” says Frederick, in his emphatic utterance, “is
a bargain. A state should have law courts to enforce contracts
entered into in their territories.”</p>

<p>The doge and senate were brought to terms. They seized the
beautiful Barberina, placed her carefully in a post-chaise, and,
under an escort of armed men, sent her, from stage to stage, over
mountain and valley, till she arrived at Berlin. The Venetian
embassador was then discharged. The young English gentleman,
James Mackenzie, a grandson of the celebrated advocate,
Sir George Mackenzie, eagerly followed his captured inamorata,
and reached Berlin two hours after Barberina. The rumor was
circulated that he was about to marry her.</p>

<p>It is said that Frederick, determined not to lose his dancer in
that manner, immediately informed the young gentleman’s friends
that he was about to form a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mesalliance</i> with an opera girl.
The impassioned lover was peremptorily summoned home. Hatred
for Frederick consequently rankled in young Mackenzie’s
heart. This hatred he communicated to his brother, Lord Bute,
which subsequently had no little influence in affairs of national
diplomacy.</p>

<p>The king himself became much fascinated with the personal
loveliness and the sparkling intelligence of the young dancer.
He even condescended to take tea with her, in company with
others. Not long after her arrival in Berlin she made a conquest
of a young gentleman of one of the first Prussian families,
M. Cocceji, son of the celebrated chancellor, and was privately
married to him. For a time Barberina continued upon the stage.
At length, in the enjoyment of ample wealth, she purchased a
splendid mansion, and, publicly announcing her marriage, retired
with her husband to private life. But the mother of Cocceji,
and other proud family friends, scorned the lowly alliance. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
divorce was the result. Soon after, Barberina was married to a
nobleman of high rank, and we hear of her no more.</p>

<p>Though Frederick, in his private correspondence, often spoke
very contemptuously of Voltaire, it would seem, if any reliance
can be placed on the testimony of Voltaire himself, that Frederick
sedulously courted the author, whose pen was then so potential
in Europe. By express invitation, Voltaire spent a week
with Frederick at Aix la Chapelle early in September, 1742.
He writes to a friend from Brussels under date of December 10:</p>

<p>“I have been to see the King of Prussia. I have courageously
resisted his fine proposals. He offers me a beautiful house in
Berlin, a pretty estate, but I prefer my second floor in Madame
Du Châtelet’s here. He assures me of his favor, of the perfect
freedom I should have; and I am running to Paris, to my slavery
and persecution. I could fancy myself a small Athenian refusing
the bounties of the King of Persia; with this difference,
however, one had liberty at Athens.”</p>

<p>Again he writes, under the same date, to the Marquis D’Argenson:</p>

<p>“I have just been to see the King of Prussia. I have seen
him as one seldom sees kings, much at my ease, in my own room,
in the chimney-corner, whither the same man who has gained
two battles would come and talk familiarly, as Scipio did with
Terence. You will tell me I am not Terence. True; but neither
is he altogether Scipio.”</p>

<p>Again he writes, under the same date, to Cardinal De Fleury,
then the most prominent member of the cabinet of Louis XV.:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,—I am bound to give your excellency some
account of my journey to Aix la Chapelle. I could not leave
Brussels until the second of this month. On the road I met a
courier from the King of Prussia, coming to reiterate his master’s
orders on me. The king had me lodged in quarters near his
own apartment. He passed, for two consecutive days, four hours
at a time in my room, with all that goodness and familiarity
which form, as you know, part of his character, and which does
not lower the king’s dignity, because one is duly careful not to
abuse it. I had abundant time to speak with a great deal of
freedom on what your excellency had prescribed to me, and the
king spoke to me with an equal frankness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
“First he asked me ‘if it were true that the French nation
were so angered against him, if the king was, and if you were.’
I answered ‘that there was nothing permanent.’ He then condescended
to speak fully upon the reasons which induced him
to make peace. These reasons were so remarkable that I dare
not trust them to this paper. All that I dare say is, that it
seems to me easy to lead back the mind of this sovereign, whom
the situation of his territories, his interest, and his taste would
appear to mark as the natural ally of France. He said, moreover,
‘that he earnestly desired to see Bohemia in the emperor’s
hands, that he renounced all claim on Berg and Jülick, and that
he thought only of keeping Silesia.’ He said ‘that he knew
well enough that the house of Austria would one day wish to
recover that fine province, but that he trusted he could keep his
conquest. That he had at that time a hundred and thirty thousand
soldiers perfectly prepared for war; that he would make
of Neisse, Glogau, and Brieg fortresses as strong as Wesel; that
he was well informed that the Queen of Hungary owed eighty
million German crowns ($60,000,000); that her provinces, exhausted
and wide apart, would not be able to make long efforts;
and that the Austrians for a long time to come could not of themselves
be formidable.’”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>Frederick was accustomed to cover his deep designs of diplomacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
by the promotion of the utmost gayety in his capital. Never
did Berlin exhibit such spectacles of festivity and pleasure as
during the winter of 1742 and 1743. There was a continued succession
of operas, balls, fêtes, and sleigh-parties. Frederick’s two
younger sisters were at that time brilliant ornaments of his court.
They were both remarkably beautiful and vivacious. The Princess
Louise Ulrique was in her twenty-third year. The following
letter to Frederick from these two princesses will be keenly
appreciated by many of our young lady readers whose expenses
have exceeded their allowance. It shows very conclusively that
there may be the same pecuniary annoyances in the palaces of
kings as in more humble homes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
“Berlin, 1st of March, 1743.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest Brother</span>,—I know not if it is not too bold to
trouble your majesty on private affairs. But the great confidence
my sister and I have in your kindness encourages us to lay before
you a sincere avowal of our little finances, which are a good
deal deranged just now. The revenues, having for two years
and a half past been rather small, amounting to only four hundred
crowns ($300) a year, could not be made to cover all the
little expenses required in the adjustment of ladies. This circumstance,
added to our card-playing, though small, which we
could not dispense with, has led us into debt. Mine amounts
to fifteen hundred crowns ($1125); my sister’s, to eighteen hundred
crowns ($1350). We have not spoken of it to the queen-mother,
though we are sure she would have tried to assist us.
But as that could not have been done without some inconvenience
to her, and as she would have retrenched in some of her
own little entertainments, I thought we should do better to apply
directly to your majesty. We were persuaded you would
have taken it amiss had we deprived the queen of her smallest
pleasure, and especially as we consider you, my dear brother, the
father of the family, and hope you will be so gracious as to help
us. We shall never forget the kind acts of your majesty. We
beg you to be persuaded of the perfect and tender attachment
with which we are proud to be, all our lives, your majesty’s
most humble sisters and servants,</p>

<p class="sigright">

<p>“P.S.—I most humbly beg your majesty not to speak of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
to the queen-mother, as perhaps she would not approve of the
step we are now taking.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Ann Amelia.</span>”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>About this time Frederick was somewhat alarmed by a statement
issued by the court of Austria, that the emperor, Charles
Albert, was no legitimate emperor at all; that the election was
not valid; and that Austria, which had the emperor’s kingdom
of Bavaria by the throat, insisted upon compensation for the Silesia
she had lost. It was evident that Maria Theresa, whose
armies were every where successful, was determined that her
husband, Duke Francis, should be decorated with the imperial
crown. It now seemed probable that she would be able to accomplish
her design. Frederick was alarmed, and deemed it
necessary to strengthen himself by matrimonial alliances.</p>

<p>The heir to the Russian throne was an orphan boy, Peter
Federowitz. The Russian court was looking around to obtain
for him a suitable wife. Frederick’s commandant at Stettin, a
man of renowned lineage, had a beautiful daughter of fourteen.
She was a buxom girl, full of life as she frolicked upon the ramparts
of the fortress with her young companions. Frederick succeeded
in obtaining her betrothal to the young Prince of Russia.
She was solemnly transferred from the Protestant to the Greek
religion; her name was changed to Catharine; and she was
eventually married, greatly to the satisfaction of Frederick, to
the young Russian czar.</p>

<p>Adolph Frederick was the heir to the throne of Sweden. Successful
diplomacy brought a magnificent embassy from Stockholm
to Berlin, to demand Princess Ulrique as the bride of
Sweden’s future king. The course of love, whether true or false,
certainly did in this case run smooth. The marriage ceremony
was attended in Berlin with such splendor as the Prussian capital
had never witnessed before. The beautiful Ulrique was
very much beloved. She was married by proxy, her brother
Augustus William standing in the place of the bridegroom.</p>

<p>All eyes were dimmed with tears as, after a week of brilliant
festivities, she prepared for her departure. The carriages were
at the door to convey her, with her accompanying suite of lords
and ladies, to Stralsund, where the Swedish senate and nobles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
were to receive her. The princess entered the royal apartment
to take leave of her friends, dressed in a rose-colored riding-habit
trimmed with silver. The vest which encircled her slender waist
was of sea-green, with lappets and collar of the same. She wore
a small English bonnet of black velvet with a white plume.
Her flowing hair hung in ringlets over her shoulders, bound with
rose-colored ribbon.</p>

<p>The king, who was devotedly attached to his sister, and who
was very fond, on all occasions, of composing rhymes which he
called poetry, wrote a very tender ode, bidding her adieu. It
commenced with the words</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Partez, ma sœur, partez;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">La Suède vous attend, la Suède<br /></span>
<span class="i0">vous désire.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Go, my sister, go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweden waits you, Sweden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">wishes you.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“His majesty gave it to her at the moment when she was
about to take leave of the two queens. The princess threw her
eyes on it and fell into a faint. The king had almost done the
like. His tears flowed abundantly. The princes and princesses
were overcome with sorrow. At last Gotter judged it time to
put an end to this tragic scene. He entered the hall almost like
Boreas in the ballet of “The Rose”—that is to say, with a crash.
He made one or two whirlwinds, clove the press, and snatched
away the princess from the arms of the queen-mother, took her
in his own, and whisked her out of the hall. All the world followed.
The carriages were waiting in the court, and the princess
in a moment found herself in hers.</p>

<p>“I was in such a state I know not how we got down stairs. I
remember only that it was in a concert of lamentable sobbings.
Madame, the Marchioness of Schwedt, who had been named to
attend the princess to Stralsund, on the Swedish frontier, this
high lady, and the two dames D’Atours, who were for Sweden
itself, having sprung into the same carriage, the door of it was
shut with a slam, the postillions cracked, the carriage shot away,
and disappeared from our eyes. In a moment the king and
court lost sight of the beloved Ulrique forever.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>Frederick was far from being an amiable man. He would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
often cruelly banter his companions, knowing that it was impossible
for them to indulge in any retort. Baron Pöllnitz was a
very weak old man, who had several times changed his religion
to subserve his private interests. He had been rather a petted
courtier during three reigns. Now, in extreme old age, and weary
of the world, he wished to renounce Protestantism, and to enter
the cloisters of the convent in preparation for death. He applied
to the king for permission to do so. Frederick furnished
him with the following sarcastic parting testimony. It was
widely circulated through many of the journals of that day, exciting
peals of laughter as a capital royal joke:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Whereas the Baron De Pöllnitz, born of honest parents, so
far as we know, having served our grandfather as gentleman of
the chamber, Madame D’Orleans in the same rank, the King of
Spain as colonel, the deceased Emperor Charles VI. as captain
of horse, the pope as chamberlain, the Duke of Brunswick as
chamberlain, the Duke of Weimar as ensign, our father as chamberlain,
and, in fine, <em>us</em> as grand master of ceremonies, has, notwithstanding
such accumulation of honors, become disgusted
with the world, and requests of us a parting testimony;</p>

<p>“We, remembering his important services to our house in diverting
for nine years long the late king our father, and doing
the honors of our court through the now reign, can not refuse
such request. We do hereby certify that the said Baron Pöllnitz
has never assassinated, robbed on the highway, poisoned,
forcibly cut purses, or done other atrocity or legal crime at our
court; but that he has always maintained gentlemanly behavior,
making not more than honest use of the industry and talents he
has been endowed with at birth; imitating the object of the
drama—that is, correcting mankind by gentle quizzing—following
in the matter of sobriety Boerhaave’s counsels, pushing Christian
charity so far as often to make the rich understand that it
is more blessed to give than to receive; possessing perfectly the
anecdotes of our various mansions, especially of our worn-out furnitures,
rendering himself by his merits necessary to those who
know him, and, with a very bad head, having a very good heart.</p>

<p>“Our anger the said Baron Pöllnitz never kindled but once.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
But as the loveliest countries have their barren spots, the most
beautiful forms their imperfections, pictures by the greatest masters
their faults, we are willing to cover with the veil of oblivion
those of the said baron. We do hereby grant him, with regret,
the leave of absence he requires, and abolish his office altogether,
that it may be blotted from the memory of man, not judging
that any one, after the said baron, can be worthy to fill it.</p>

<p>No man of kindly sympathies could have thus wantonly
wounded the feelings of a poor old man who had, according to
his capacity, served himself, his father, and his grandfather, and
who was just dropping into the grave. A generous heart would
have forgotten the foibles, and, remembering only the virtues,
would have spoken words of cheer to the world-weary heart,
seeking a sad refuge in the glooms of the cloister. It must be
confessed that Frederick often manifested one of the worst traits
in human nature. He took pleasure in inflicting pain upon
others.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">The</span> correspondence carried on between Frederick and Voltaire,
and their mutual comments, very clearly reveal the relations
existing between these remarkable men. Frederick was
well aware that the eloquent pen of the great dramatist and historian
could give him celebrity throughout Europe. Voltaire
was keenly alive to the consideration that the friendship of a
monarch could secure to him position and opulence. And yet
each privately spoke of the other very contemptuously, while in
the correspondence which passed between them they professed
for each other the highest esteem and affection. Frederick
wrote from Berlin as follows to Voltaire:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
“October 7, 1743.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Voltaire</span>,—France has been considered thus far
as the asylum of unfortunate monarchs. I wish that my capital
should become the temple of great men. Come to it, then, my
dear Voltaire, and give whatever orders can tend to render a
residence in it agreeable to you. My wish is to please you, and
wishing this, my intention is to enter entirely into your views.</p>

<p>“Choose whatever apartment in our house you like. Regulate
yourself all that you want, either for comfort or luxury.
Make your arrangements in such a way as that you may be happy
and comfortable, and leave it to me to provide for the rest.
You will be always entirely free, and master to choose your own
way of life. My only pretension is to enchain you by friendship
and kindness.</p>

<p>“You will have passports for the post-horses, and whatever
else you may ask. I hope to see you on Wednesday. I shall
then profit by the few moments of leisure which remain to me,
to enlighten myself by the blaze of your powerful genius. I
entreat you to believe I shall always be the same toward you.
Adieu.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Voltaire has given a detailed account of the incidents connected
with this visit to his Prussian majesty. It is a humiliating
exhibition of the intrigues and insincerity which animated
the prominent actors in those scenes.</p>

<p>“The public affairs in France,” writes Voltaire, “continued in
as bad a state after the death of Cardinal De Fleury as during
the last two years of his administration. The house of Austria
rose again from its ashes. France was cruelly pressed upon by
that power and by England. No other resource remained to us
but the chance of regaining the King of Prussia, who, having
drawn us into the war, had abandoned us as soon as it was convenient
to himself so to do. It was thought advisable, under
these circumstances, that I should be sent to that monarch to
sound his intentions, and, if possible, persuade him to avert the
storm which, after it had first fallen on us, would be sure, sooner
or later, to fall from Vienna upon him. We also wished to secure
from him the loan of a hundred thousand men, with the assurance
that he could thus better secure to himself Silesia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
“The minister for foreign affairs was charged to hasten my
departure. A pretext, however, was necessary. I took that of
my quarrel with the Bishop Mirepoix. I wrote accordingly to
the King of Prussia that I could no longer endure the persecutions
of this monk, and that I should take refuge under the protection
of a philosophical sovereign, far from the disputes of this
bigot. When I arrived at Berlin the king lodged me in his palace,
as he had done in my former journeys. He then led the
same sort of life which he had always done since he came to the
throne. He rose at five in summer and six in winter.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> A single
servant came to light his fire, to dress and shave him. Indeed,
he dressed himself almost without any assistance. His
bedroom was a handsome one. A rich and highly ornamented
balustrade of silver inclosed apparently a bed hung with curtains,
but behind the curtains, instead of a bed, there was a library.
As for the royal couch, it was a wretched truckle-bed,
with a thin mattress, behind a screen, in one corner of the room.
Marcus Aurelius and Julian, his favorite heroes, and the greatest
men among the Stoics, were not worse lodged.”</p>

<p>The king devoted himself very energetically to business during
the morning, and reviewed his troops at eleven o’clock. He
dined at twelve.</p>

<p>“After dinner,” writes Voltaire, “the king retired alone into
his cabinet, and made verses till five or six o’clock. A concert
commenced at seven, in which the king performed on the flute
as well as the best musician. The pieces of music executed were
also often of the king’s composition. On the days of public ceremonies
he exhibited great magnificence. It was a fine spectacle
to see him at table, surrounded by twenty princes of the empire,
served on the most beautiful gold plate in Europe, and attended
by thirty handsome pages, and as many young heyducs, superbly
dressed, and carrying great dishes of massive gold. After
these banquets the court attended the opera in the great theatre,
three hundred feet long. The most admirable singers and the
best dancers were at this time in the pay of the King of Prussia.”</p>

<p>Voltaire seems to have formed a very different estimate of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
own diplomatic abilities from those expressed by the King of
Prussia. Voltaire writes:</p>

<p>“In the midst of fêtes, operas, and suppers, my secret negotiation
advanced. The king allowed me to speak to him on all
subjects. I often intermingled questions respecting France and
Austria in conversations relating to the Æneid and Livy. The
discussion was sometimes very animated. At length the king
said to me, ‘Let France declare war against England, and I will
march.’ This was all I desired. I returned as quickly as possible
to the court of France. I gave them the same hopes which
I had myself been led to entertain at Berlin, and which did not
prove delusive.”</p>

<p>The fact was, that the diplomacy of Voltaire had probably
not the slightest influence in guiding the action of the king.
Frederick had become alarmed in view of the signal successes of
the armies of Maria Theresa, under her brother-in-law, Prince
Charles of Lorraine. Several Austrian generals, conspicuous
among whom was Marshal Traun, were developing great military
ability. The armies of Austria had conquered Bohemia and
Bavaria. The French troops, discomfited in many battles, had
been compelled to retreat to the western banks of the Rhine,
vigorously pursued by Prince Charles. The impotent emperor
Charles Albert, upon whom France had placed the imperial
crown of Germany, was driven from his hereditary realm, and
the heart-broken man, in poverty and powerlessness, was an emperor
but in name. It was evident that Maria Theresa was
gathering her strength to reconquer Silesia. She had issued a
decree that the Elector of Bavaria was not legitimately chosen
emperor. It was very manifest that her rapidly increasing influence
would soon enable her to dethrone the unfortunate
Charles Albert, and to place the imperial crown upon the brow
of her husband.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it was evidently impossible for
Frederick to retain Silesia unless he could again rally France
and other powers to his aid. It was always easy to rouse France
against England, its hereditary foe. Thus influenced, Frederick,
early in the spring of 1744, entered into a new alliance with
France and the Emperor Charles Albert against Maria Theresa.
The two marriages which he had so adroitly consummated constrained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
Russia and Sweden to neutrality. While France, by
the new treaty, was engaged to assail with the utmost energy,
under the leadership of Louis XV. himself, the triumphant Austrian
columns upon the Rhine, Frederick, at the head of one hundred
thousand troops, was to drive the Austrians out of Bohemia,
and reseat Charles Albert upon his hereditary throne. For
this service Frederick was to receive from the Bohemian king
three important principalities, with their central fortresses near
upon the borders of Silesia.</p>

<p>The shrewd foresight of Frederick, and his rapidly developing
military ability, had kept his army in the highest state of discipline,
while his magazines were abundantly stored with all
needful supplies. It was written at the time:</p>

<p>“Some countries take six months, some twelve, to get in motion
for war. But in three weeks Prussia can be across the frontiers
and upon the throats of its enemy. Some countries have a
longer sword than Prussia, but none can unsheath it so soon.”</p>

<p>Public opinion was then much less potent than now; still it
was a power. Frederick had two objects in view in again drawing
the sword. One was to maintain possession of Silesia, which
was seriously menaced; the other was to enlarge his territory,
and thus to strengthen his hold upon his new conquest, by adding
to Prussia the three important Bohemian principalities of
Königgratz, Bunzlau, and Leitmeritz. By a secret treaty, he had
secured the surrender of these provinces in payment for the assistance
his armies might furnish the allies; but policy required
that he should not avow his real motives. He therefore issued
a manifesto, in which he falsely stated,</p>

<p>“His Prussian majesty requires nothing for himself. He has
taken up arms simply and solely with the view of restoring to
the empire its freedom, to the emperor his imperial crown, and
to all Europe the peace which is so desirable.”</p>

<p>Frederick published his manifesto on the 10th of August,
1744. Early in the morning of the 15th he set out from Potsdam
upon this new military expedition. His two eldest brothers,
Augustus William, Prince of Prussia, and Prince Henry, accompanied
him. The army entered Bohemia in three columns,
whose concentrated force amounted to nearly one hundred thousand
men. Frederick in person led the first column, the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
Prince Leopold the second, and Marshal Schwerin the third.
Marching by different routes, they swept all opposition before
them. On the 4th of September the combined army appeared
before the walls of Prague. Here, as in every act of Frederick’s
life, his marvelous energy was conspicuous.</p>

<p>The works were pushed with the utmost vigor. On the 8th
the siege cannon arrived; late in the night of Wednesday, the
9th, they were in position. Immediately they opened their rapid,
well-aimed, deadly fire of solid shot and shell from three quarters—the
north, the west, and the east. Frederick, watching the
bombardment from an eminence, was much exposed to the return
fire of the Austrians. He called upon others to take care
of themselves, but seemed regardless of his own personal safety.
His cousin, Prince William, and a page, were both struck down
at his side by a cannon-ball.</p>

<p>On the 16th the battered, smouldering, blood-stained city was
surrendered, with its garrison of sixteen thousand men. The
prisoners of war were marched off to Frederick’s strong places
in the north. Prague was compelled to take the oath of allegiance
to the emperor, and to pay a ransom of a million of dollars.
Abundant stores of provision and ammunition were found
in the city. It was a brilliant opening of the campaign.</p>

<p>The impetuous Frederick made no delay at Prague. The day
after the capture, leaving five thousand men, under General Einsiedel,
to garrison the city, he put his troops in motion, ascending
the right bank of the Moldau. It would seem that he was
about to march boldly upon Vienna. Wagons of meal, drawn
by oxen, followed the army. The heavy artillery was left behind.
The troops were forced along as rapidly as possible.
They advanced in two columns. One was led by Frederick, and
the other by young Leopold. The country through which they
passed was dreary, desolate, barren in the extreme—a wild waste
of precipitous rocks, and bogs, and tangled forest. The roads
were wretched. No forage could be obtained. The starved
oxen were continually dropping, exhausted, by the way; the
path of the army was marked by their carcasses.</p>

<p>It was but sixty miles from Prague to Tabor. The march of
Frederick’s division led through Kunraditz, across the Sazawa
River, through Bistritz and Miltchin. It was not until the ninth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
day of their toilsome march that the steeples of Tabor were descried,
in the distant horizon, on its high, scarped rock. Here
both columns united. Half of the draught cattle had perished
by the way, and half of the wagons had been abandoned.</p>

<div id="ip_332" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.875em;">
  <img src="images/i_332.jpg" width="462" height="460" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">THE PANDOURS.</div></div>

<p>The prospects of Frederick were now gloomy. The bright
morning of the campaign had darkened into a stormy day. The
barren region around afforded no supplies. The inhabitants
were all Catholics; they hated the heretics. Inspired by their
priests, they fled from their dwellings, taking with them or destroying
every thing which could aid the Prussian army. But
most annoying of all, the bold, sagacious chieftain, General Bathyani,
with hordes of Pandours which could not be counted—horsemen
who seemed to have the vitality and endurance of centaurs—was
making deadly assaults upon every exposed point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
“Such a swarm of hornets as darkens the very daylight!”
writes Carlyle. “Vain to scourge them down, to burn them off
by blaze of gunpowder; they fly fast, but are straightway back
again. They lurk in these bushy wildernesses, scraggy woods;
no foraging possible unless whole regiments are sent out to do
it; you can not get a letter safely carried for them.”</p>

<p>Thus Frederick found himself in a barren, hostile country, with
a starving army, incessantly assailed by a determined foe, groping
his way in absolute darkness, and with the greatest difficulty
communicating even with his own divisions, at the distance
of but a few leagues. He knew not from what direction to anticipate
attack, or how formidable might be his assailants. He
knew not whether the French, on the other side of the Rhine,
had abandoned him to his own resources, or were marching to
his rescue. He knew that they were as supremely devoted to
their own interests as he was to his, and that they would do
nothing to aid him, unless by so doing they could efficiently benefit
themselves.</p>

<p>As is usual under such circumstances, a quarrel arose among
his officers. Young Leopold proposed one plan, Marshal Schwerin
another. They were both bold, determined men. Frederick
found it difficult to keep the peace between them. It was now
October. Winter, with its piercing gales, and ice, and snow, was
fast approaching. It was necessary to seek winter quarters.
Frederick, with the main body of his army, took possession of
Budweis, on the Upper Moldau. A detachment was stationed
at Neuhaus, about thirty miles northeast of Budweis.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Prince Charles was at the head of
a strong Austrian army, on the western banks of the Rhine. It
numbered over fifty thousand combatants. The King of France
had pledged himself to press them closely, so that they could
not recross the Rhine and rush into Bohemia to thwart the operations
of Frederick; but, unfortunately, Louis XV. was seized
with a malignant fever, which brought him near to the grave.
Taking advantage of this, Prince Charles, on the night of the 23d
of August, crossed the Rhine with his whole army. It was
bright moonlight, so that every movement was as visible as if it
had been made by day. But the French officers, glad thus to
be rid of the Austrian army, preferring much that Frederick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
should encounter it in Bohemia than that they should struggle
against it on the Rhine, went quietly to their beds, even forbidding
the more zealous subalterns from harassing Prince Charles
in his passage of the river. It was then the great object of the
French to take Freyburg. The withdrawal of Prince Charles,
with his fifty thousand men, was a great relief to them.</p>

<p>While Frederick was involved in all these difficulties, he was
cheered by the hope that the French would soon come to his
rescue. Unutterable was his chagrin when he learned, early in
October, that the French had done exactly as he would have
done in their circumstances. Appalling, indeed, were the tidings
soon brought to him, that Prince Charles, with his army, had
marched unmolested into Bohemia; that he had already effected
a junction with General Bathyani and his countless swarm of
Pandours; and, moreover, that a Saxon army, twenty thousand
strong, in alliance with the Queen of Hungary, was on the way
to join his already overwhelming foes. It was reported, at the
same time, that Prince Charles was advancing upon Budweis,
and that his advance-guard had been seen, but a few miles off,
on the western side of the Moldau.</p>

<p>The exigency demanded the most decisive action. Frederick
promptly gathered his army, and dashed across the Moldau, resolved,
with the energies of despair, to smite down the troops of
Prince Charles; but no foe could be found. For four days he
sought for them in vain. He then learned that the Austrian
army had crossed the Moldau several miles north of him, thus
cutting off his communications with Prague.</p>

<p>Though Prince Charles was nominally commander-in-chief of
the Austrian forces, Marshal Traun, as we have mentioned, was
its military head. He was, at that time, far Frederick’s superior
in the art of war. Frederick had sufficient intelligence and candor
to recognize that superiority. When he heard of this adroit
movement of his foes, he exclaimed, “Old Traun understands his
trade.”</p>

<p>Prince Charles was now forming magazines at Beneschau, just
south of the Sazawa River, about seventy miles north of Frederick’s
encampment at Budweis. Frederick hastily recrossed the
Moldau, and, marching through Bechin, concentrated nearly all
his forces at Tabor. He hoped by forced marches to take the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
Austrians by surprise, and capture their magazines at Beneschau.
Thousands, rumor said fourteen thousand, of the wild Pandours,
riding furiously, hovered around his line of march. They were
in his front, on his rear, and upon his flanks. Ever refusing battle,
they attacked every exposed point with the utmost ferocity.
The Prussian king thus found himself cut off from Prague, with
exhausted magazines, and forage impossible. He had three hundred
sick in his hospitals. He could not think of abandoning
them, and yet he had no means for their transportation.</p>

<p>The salvation of the army seemed to depend upon capturing
the Austrian magazines at Beneschau. Marshal Schwerin was
sent forward with all speed, at the head of a strong detachment,
and was so lucky as to take Beneschau. Here he intrenched
himself. Frederick, upon hearing the glad tidings, immediately
started from Tabor to join him. His sick were at Fraunberg,
Budweis, and Neuhaus, some dozen miles south of Tabor. Garrisons,
amounting to three thousand men, had been left to protect
them from the Pandours. As Frederick was about to abandon
that whole region, it was manifest that these garrisons could
not maintain themselves. He dispatched eight messengers in
succession to summon the troops immediately to join him. The
sick were to be left to their fate. It was one of the cruel necessities
of war. But not one of these messengers escaped capture
by the Pandours. Frederick commenced his march without these
garrisons. The three thousand fighting men, with the three hundred
sick, all fell into the hands of the Pandours.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">Frederick</span> concentrated his army at Konopischt, very near
Beneschau. He could bring into the field sixty thousand men.
Prince Charles was at the head of seventy thousand. In vain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
the Prussian king strove to bring his foes to a pitched battle.
Adroitly Prince Charles avoided any decisive engagement.
Frederick was fifty miles from Prague. The roads were quagmires.
November gales swept his camp. A foe, superior in
numbers, equal in bravery, surrounded him on all sides. The
hostile army was led by a general whose greater military ability
Frederick acknowledged.</p>

<p>A council of war was held. It was decided to commence an
immediate and rapid retreat to Silesia. Prague, with its garrison
of five thousand men, and its siege artillery, was to be abandoned
to its fate. Word was sent to General Einsiedel to spike
his guns, blow up his bastions, throw his ammunition into the
river, and to escape, if possible, down the valley of the Moldau,
to Leitmeritz.</p>

<p>Frederick divided his retreating army into two columns.
One, led by the young Leopold, was to retire through Glatz.
The other, led by Frederick, traversed a road a few leagues to
the west, passing through Königgratz. It was an awful retreat
for both these divisions—through snow, and sleet, and mud, hungry,
weary, freezing, with swarms of Pandours hanging upon
their rear. Thousands perished by the way. The horrors of
such a retreat no pen can describe. Their very guides deserted
them, and became spies, to report their movements to the foe.</p>

<p>On one occasion the king himself narrowly escaped being taken
prisoner. One of his officers, General Trenck, gives the following
graphic narrative of the incident:</p>

<p>“One day the king entered the town of Collin, with his horse
and foot guard and the whole of the baggage. We had but
four small field-pieces with us. The squadron to which I belonged
was placed in the suburb. In the evening our advanced
posts were driven back into the town, and the huzzas of the
enemy followed them pell-mell. All the country around was
covered with the light troops of the Austrians. My commandant
sent me to the king to take his orders.</p>

<p>“After a long search, I at length found him in a tower of a
church, with a telescope in his hand. Never had I seen him in
so much perplexity and anxiety as at this moment. The order
he gave me was, ‘You must get out of this scrape as well as
you can.’ I had hardly got back to my post when his adjutant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
followed me with a new order to cross the town, and to remain
on horseback with my squadron in the opposite suburb.</p>

<div id="ip_337" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.6875em;">
  <img src="images/i_337.jpg" width="459" height="454" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">THE KING IN THE TOWER AT COLLIN.</div></div>

<p>“We had just arrived there when it began to rain heavily,
and the night became exceedingly dark. About nine o’clock
one of the Austrian generals approached us with his light troops,
and set fire to the houses close to which we were posted. By
the blaze of the conflagration he soon discovered us, and began
firing at us from the windows. The town was so full that it
was impossible for us to find a place in it. Besides, the gate
was barricaded, and from the top they were firing at us with
our small field-pieces, which they had captured.</p>

<p>“In the mean time the Austrians had turned in upon us a rivulet,
and by midnight we found our horses in the water up to
their bellies. We were really incapable of defending ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
Just at that time, when all hope seemed lost, it so happened
that a cannon-ball crushed the foot of the Austrian commander.
This disaster, together with the darkness and the torrents of rain,
caused the fire of the enemy to cease. The next morning some
Prussian re-enforcements came to the rescue of the king, and he
escaped.</p>

<p>It was on the night of the 25th of November, cold and dreary,
that General Einsiedel commenced his retreat from Prague. He
pushed his wagon trains out before him, and followed with his
horse and foot. The Austrians were on the alert. Their light
horsemen came clattering into the city ere the rear-guard had
left. The Catholic populace of the city, being in sympathy with
the Austrians, immediately joined the Pandours in a fierce attack
upon the Prussians. The retreating columns were torn by
a terrific fire from the windows of the houses, from bridges, from
boats, from every point whence a bullet could reach them. But
the well-drilled Prussians met the shock with the stern composure
of machines, leaving their path strewn with the dying and
the dead.</p>

<p>The heroic General Einsiedel struggled along through the
snow and over the pathless hills, pursued and pelted every hour
by the indomitable foe. He was often compelled to abandon
baggage-wagons and ambulances containing the sick, while the
wounded and the exhausted sank freezing by the way. At one
time he was so crowded by the enemy that he was compelled
to continue his march through the long hours of a wintry night,
by the light of pitch-pine torches. After this awful retreat of
twenty days, an emaciate, ragged, frostbitten band crossed the
frontier into Silesia, near Friedland. They were soon united
with the other columns of the discomfited and almost ruined
army.</p>

<p>It will generally be admitted by military men that Frederick
did not display much ability of generalship in this campaign.
He was fearless, indomitable in energy, and tireless in the endurance
of fatigue, but in generalship he was entirely eclipsed
by his formidable rival. Indeed, Frederick could not be blind
to this, and he had sufficient candor to confess it. Subsequently,
giving an account of these transactions in his “Works,” he
writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
“No general has committed more faults than did the king in
this campaign. The conduct of Marshal Traun is a model of
perfection, which every soldier who loves his business ought to
study, and try to imitate if he have the talent. The king has
admitted that he himself regarded this campaign as his school
in the art of war, and Marshal Traun as his teacher.”</p>

<p>He then adds the philosophical reflection: “Bad is often better
for princes than good. Instead of intoxicating them with
presumption, it renders them circumspect and modest.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>Frederick, leaving his army safe for a short time, quartered, as
he supposed, for the winter, in his strong fortresses of Silesia, returned
hastily to Berlin. It was necessary for him to make immediate
preparation for another campaign. “From December
13, 1744,” writes Carlyle, “when he hastened home to Berlin,
under such aspects, to June 4, 1745, when aspects suddenly
changed, are probably the worst six months Frederick had yet
had in the world.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>His wintry ride, a defeated monarch leaving a shattered army
behind him, must have been dark and dreary. He had already
exhausted nearly all the resources which his father, Frederick
William, had accumulated. His army was demoralized, weakened,
and his <em>materiel</em> of war greatly impaired. His subjects
were already heavily taxed. Though practicing the most rigid
economy, with his eye upon every expenditure, his disastrous
Bohemian campaign had cost him three hundred and fifty thousand
dollars a month. The least sum with which he could commence
a new campaign for the protection of Silesia was four million
five hundred thousand dollars. He had already melted up
the sumptuous plate, and the massive silver balustrades and balconies
where his father had deposited so much solid treasure.</p>

<p>“It was in these hours of apparently insurmountable difficulty
that the marvelous administrative genius of Frederick was displayed.
No modern reader can imagine the difficulties of Frederick
at this time as they already lay disclosed, and kept gradually
disclosing themselves, for months coming; nor will ever
know what perspicacity, what patience of scanning, sharpness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
discernment, dexterity of management, were required at Frederick’s
hands; and under what imminency of peril too—victorious
deliverance or ruin and annihilation, wavering fearfully in the
balance, for him more than once, or rather all along.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>To add to the embarrassments of Frederick, the King of Poland,
entirely under the control of his minister Brühl, who hated
Frederick, entered into an alliance with Maria Theresa, and engaged
to furnish her with thirty thousand troops, who were to
be supported by the sea powers England and Holland, who
were also in close alliance with Austria.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa, greatly elated by her success in driving the
Prussians out of Bohemia, resolved immediately, notwithstanding
the severity of the season, to push her armies through the
“Giant Mountains” for the reconquering of Silesia. She ordered
her generals to press on with the utmost energy and overrun
the whole country. At the same time she issued a manifesto,
declaring that the treaty of Breslau was a treaty no longer;
that the Silesians were absolved from all oaths of allegiance to
the King of Prussia, and that they were to hold themselves in
readiness to take the oath anew to the Queen of Hungary.</p>

<p>On the 18th of December a strong Austrian army entered Silesia
and took possession of the country of Glatz. The Prussian
troops were withdrawn in good order to their strong fortresses
on the Oder. The old Prince Leopold, the cast-iron man, called
the Old Dessauer, the most inflexible of mortals, was left in command
of the Prussian troops. He was, however, quite seriously
alienated from Frederick. A veteran soldier, having spent his
lifetime on fields of blood, and having served the monarchs of
Prussia when Frederick was but a child, and who had been the
military instructor of the young prince, he deemed himself entitled
to consideration which an inexperienced officer might not
command. In one of the marches to which we have referred,
Leopold ventured to take a route different from that which
Frederick had prescribed to him. In the following terms the
Prussian king reprimanded him for his disobedience:</p>

<p>“I am greatly surprised that your excellency does not more
accurately follow my orders. If you were more skillful than
Cæsar, and did not with strict fidelity obey my directions, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
else were of no help to me. I hope this notice, once for all, will
be enough, and that in future you will give no cause for complaint.”</p>

<p>Prince Leopold was keenly wounded by this reproof. Though
he uttered not a word in self-defense, he was ever after, in the
presence of his majesty, very silent, distant, and reserved. Though
scrupulously faithful in every duty, he compelled the king to
feel that an impassable wall of separation had risen up between
them. He was seeking for an honorable pretext to withdraw
from his majesty’s service.</p>

<p>Frederick had hardly reached Berlin ere he was astonished to
learn, from dispatches from the Old Dessauer, that the Austrians,
not content with driving him out of Bohemia, had actually invaded
Silesia. Amazed, or affecting amazement, at such audacity,
he sent reiterated and impatient orders to his veteran general
to fall immediately upon the insolent foe and crush him.</p>

<p>“Hurl them out,” he wrote. “Gather twenty, thirty thousand
men, if need be. Let there be no delay. I will as soon be pitched
out of Brandenburg as out of Silesia.”</p>

<p>But it was much easier for Frederick to issue these orders
than for Leopold to execute them. As Leopold could not, in a
day, gather sufficient force to warrant an attack upon the Austrians,
the king was greatly irritated, and allowed himself to
write to Leopold in a strain of which he must afterward have
been much ashamed. On the 19th he addressed a note to the
veteran officer couched in the following terms:</p>

<p>“On the 21st I leave Berlin, and mean to be at Neisse on the
24th at least. Your excellency will, in the mean time, make out
the order of battle for the regiments which have come in. For
I will, on the 25th, without delay, cross the Neisse, and attack
those people, cost what it may, and chase them out of Silesia,
and follow them as far as possible. You will, therefore, take
measure and provide every thing, that the project may be executed
the moment I arrive.”</p>

<p>In this fiery humor, the king leaped upon his horse and galloped
to Schweidnitz. Here he met the Old Dessauer. He must
have been not a little mortified to learn that his veteran general
was right, and he utterly in the wrong. Prince Charles had returned
home. Marshal Traun was in command of the Austrians.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
He had a compact army of 20,000 men, flushed with victory and
surrounded by countless thousands of Pandours, who veiled every
movement from view. He had established himself in an impregnable
position on the south side of the Neisse, where he
could not be assailed, with any prospect of success, by the force
which Leopold could then summon to his aid.</p>

<p>Frederick was silenced, humiliated. He returned to Berlin,
having accomplished nothing, and having lost four days in his
fruitless adventure. Leopold was left to accumulate his resources
as rapidly as he could, and to attack the Austrians at
his discretion.</p>

<p>Prince Charles had married the only sister of Maria Theresa.
She was young, beautiful, and amiable. While the prince was
conducting his arduous campaign on the Moldau, his wife, grief-stricken,
consigned her new-born babe to the tomb. The little
stranger, born in the absence of his father, had but opened his
eyes upon this sad world when he closed them forever. The
princess sank rapidly into a decline.</p>

<p>Charles, feeling keenly the bereavement, and alarmed for the
health of his wife, whom he loved most tenderly, hastened to his
home in Brussels. The prince and princess were vice-regents, or
“joint governors” of the Netherlands. The decline of the princess
was very rapid. On the 16th of December, the young prince,
with flooded eyes, a broken-hearted man, followed the remains of
his beloved companion to their burial. Charles never recovered
from the blow. He had been the happiest of husbands. He
sank into a state of deep despondency, and could never be induced
to wed again. Though in April he resumed, for a time,
the command of the army, his energies were wilted, his spirit
saddened, and he soon passed into oblivion. This is but one
among the countless millions of the unwritten tragedies of human
life.</p>

<p>On the 9th of January, Leopold, having gathered a well-furnished
army of 25,000 men, crossed the Neisse to attack Marshal
Traun. The marshal did not deem it prudent to hazard a battle.
Large bodies of troops were soon to be sent to re-enforce
him. He therefore retired by night toward the south, breaking
the bridges behind him. Though Silesia was thus delivered from
the main body of the Austrian army, the fleet-footed Pandours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
remained, scouring the country on their shaggy horses, plundering
and destroying. The energetic, tireless Old Dessauer could
seldom get a shot at them. But they harassed his army, keeping
the troops constantly on the march amidst the storms and
the freezing cold.</p>

<p>“The old serene highness himself, face the color of gunpowder,
and bluer in the winter frost, went rushing far and wide in an
open vehicle which he called his ‘cart,’ pushing out his detachments;
supervising every thing; wheeling hither and thither as
needful; sweeping out the Pandour world, and keeping it out;
not much fighting needed, but ‘a great deal of marching,’ murmurs
Frederick, ‘which in winter is as bad, and wears down the
force of battalions.’”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<div id="ip_343" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.25em;">
  <img src="images/i_343.jpg" width="452" height="348" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">PRINCE LEOPOLD INSPECTING THE ARMY IN HIS “CART.”</div></div>

<p>We seldom hear from Frederick any recognition of God. But
on this occasion, perhaps out of regard to the feelings of his subjects,
he ordered the <cite>Te Deum</cite> to be sung in the churches of Berlin
“for the deliverance of Silesia from invasion.”</p>

<p>On the 20th of January, 1745, Charles Albert, the unhappy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
and ever-unfortunate Emperor of Germany, died at Munich, in
the forty-eighth year of his age. Tortured by a complication of
the most painful disorders, he had seldom, for weary years, enjoyed
an hour of freedom from acute pain. An incessant series
of disasters crushed all his hopes. He was inextricably involved
in debt. Triumphant foes drove him from his realms. He wandered
a fugitive in foreign courts, exposed to humiliation and
the most cutting indignities. Thus the victim of bodily and
mental anguish, it is said that one day some new tidings of disaster
prostrated him upon the bed of death. He was patient
and mild, but the saddest of mortals. Gladly he sought refuge
in the tomb from the storms of his drear and joyless life. An
eye-witness writes, “Charles Albert’s pious and affectionate demeanor
drew tears from all eyes. The manner in which he took
leave of his empress would have melted a heart of stone.”</p>

<p>“The death of the emperor,” says Frederick, “was the only
event wanting to complete the confusion and embroilment which
already existed in the political relations of the European powers.”</p>

<p>Maximilian Joseph, son of the emperor, was at the time of his
father’s death but seventeen years of age. He was titular Elector
of Bavaria; but Austrian armies had overrun the electorate,
and he was a fugitive from his dominions. At the entreaty of
his mother, he entered into a treaty of alliance with the Queen
of Hungary. She agreed to restore to him his realms, and to
recognize his mother as empress dowager. He, on the other
hand, agreed to support the Pragmatic Sanction, and to give his
vote for the Grand-duke Francis as Emperor of Germany.</p>

<p>Thus Bavaria turned against Frederick. It was manifest to
all that Maria Theresa, aided by the alliances into which she had
entered, and sustained by the gold which the English cabinet so
generously lavished upon her, would be able to place the imperial
crown upon her husband’s brow. It was equally evident
that the sceptre of power, of which that crown was the emblem,
would be entirely in her own hands.</p>

<p>Frederick had now France only for an ally. But France was
seeking her own private interests on the Rhine, as Frederick was
aiming at the aggrandizement of Prussia on his Austrian frontiers.
Neither party was disposed to make any sacrifice for the
benefit of the other. Frederick, thus thrown mainly upon his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
own resources, with an impoverished treasury, and a weakened
and baffled army, made indirect application to both England and
Austria for peace. But both of these courts, flushed with success,
were indisposed to listen to any terms which Frederick
would propose.</p>

<p>There was nothing left for his Prussian majesty but to abandon
Silesia, and retire within his own original borders, defeated
and humiliated, the object of the contempt and ridicule of Europe,
or to press forward in the conflict, summoning to his aid
all the energies of despair.</p>

<p>Old Prince Leopold of Dessau, whom he had left in command
of the army in Silesia, was one of the most extraordinary men
of any age. He invented the iron ramrod, and also all modern
military tactics. “The soldiery of every civilized country still
receives from this man, on the parade-fields and battle-fields, its
word of command. Out of his rough head proceeded the essential
of all that the innumerable drill-sergeants in various languages
repeat and enforce.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>Dessau was a little independent principality embracing a few
square miles, about eighty miles southwest of Prussia. The
prince had a Liliputian army, and a revenue of about fifty thousand
dollars. Leopold’s mother was the sister of the great
Elector of Brandenburg’s first wife. The little principality was
thus, by matrimonial alliance as well as location, in affinity with
Prussia.</p>

<p>Leopold, in early youth, fell deeply in love with a beautiful
young lady, Mademoiselle Fos. She was the daughter of an
apothecary. His aristocratic friends were shocked at the idea
of so unequal a marriage. The sturdy will of Leopold was unyielding.
They sent him away, under a French tutor, to take
the grand tour of Europe. After an absence of fourteen months
he returned. The first thing he did was to call upon Mademoiselle
Fos. After that, he called upon his widowed mother. It
was in vain to resist the will of such a man. In 1698 he married
her, and soon, by his splendid military services, so ennobled
his bride that all were ready to do her homage. For half a century
she was his loved and honored spouse, attending him in all
his campaigns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
With a tender heart, Leopold was one of the most stern and
rugged of men. Spending his whole life amidst the storms of
battle, he seemed ever insensible to fatigue, and regardless of all
physical comforts. And yet there was a vein of truly feminine
gentleness and tenderness in his heart, which made him one of
the most loving of husbands and fathers.</p>

<p>His young daughter Louisa, bride of Victor Leopold, reigning
Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg, lay dying of a decline. A few days
before her death she said, “I wish I could see my father at the
head of his regiment once again before I die.” The remark was
reported to Leopold. He was then with his regiment at Halle,
thirty miles distant. Immediately the troops were called out,
and marched at rapid pace to Bernburg. With banners flying,
music playing, and all customary display of military pomp, they
entered the court-yard of the palace. The dying daughter, pale
and emaciate, sat at the window. The war-worn father rose in
his stirrups to salute his child, and then put his regiment through
all its most interesting manœuvrings. The soldiers were then
marched to the orphan-house, where the common men were treated
with bread and beer, all the officers dining at the prince’s table.
“All the officers except Leopold alone, who stole away out
of the crowd, sat himself upon the Saale bridge, and wept into
the river.”</p>

<p>Leopold was now seventy years of age. On the 5th of February
his much-loved wife died at Dessau. Leopold, infirm in
health, and broken with grief, entreated the king to allow him
to go home. He could not, of course, be immediately spared.</p>

<p>On the 15th of March Frederick left Berlin for Silesia. Stopping
to examine some of his works at Glogau and Breslau, he
reached Neisse on the 23d. On the 29th he dismissed the Old
Dessauer, with many expressions of kindness and sympathy, to
go home to recover his health.</p>

<p>“Old Leopold is hardly at home at Dessau,” writes Carlyle,
“when the new Pandour tempests, tides of ravaging war, again
come beating against the Giant Mountains, pouring through all
passes, huge influx of wild riding hordes, each with some support
of Austrian grenadiers, cannoniers, threatening to submerge
Silesia. Precursors, Frederick need not doubt, of a strenuous,
regular attempt that way. Hungarian majesty’s fixed intention,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
hope, and determination is to expel him straightway from
Silesia.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>The latter part of April Prince Charles had gathered a large
force of Austrian regulars at Olmütz, with the manifest intention
of again invading Silesia. The King of Poland had entered
into cordial alliance with Austria, and was sending a large army
of Saxon troops to co-operate in the enterprise. Frederick’s indignation
was great, and his peril still greater. Encamped in
the valley of the Neisse, assailed on every side, and menaced
with still more formidable foes, he dispatched orders to the Old
Dessauer immediately to establish an army of observation (thirty
thousand strong) upon the frontiers of Saxony. He was to
be prepared instantly, upon the Saxon troops leaving Saxony,
to ravage the country with the most merciless plunderings of war.</p>

<p>The Queen of Hungary had purchased the co-operation of the
Polish king by offering to surrender to him a generous portion
of Silesia after the province should have been reconquered. Indeed,
there was a great cause of apprehension that the allied
army would make a rush upon Berlin itself. The aspect of his
Prussian majesty’s affairs was now gloomy in the extreme.</p>

<p>Frederick wrote to his minister Podewils in Berlin, under date
of Neisse, March 29, 1745, as follows: “We find ourselves in a
great crisis. If we don’t by mediation of England get peace, our
enemies from different sides will come plunging in against me.
Peace I can not force them to. But if we must have war, we
will either beat them, or none of us will ever see Berlin again.”</p>

<p>On the 17th of April again he wrote, still from Neisse: “I
toil day and night to improve our situation. The soldiers will
do their duty. There is none among us who will not rather
have his back-bone broken than give up one foot-breadth of
ground. They must either grant us a good peace, or we will
surpass ourselves by miracles of daring, and force the enemy to
accept it from us.”</p>

<p>On the 20th of April he wrote: “Our situation is disagreeable,
but my determination is taken. If we needs must fight, we
will do it like men driven desperate. Never was there a greater
peril than that I am now in. Time, at its own pleasure, will untie
this knot, or destiny, if there is one, determine the event. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
game I play is so high, one can not contemplate the issue with
cold blood. Pray for the return of my good luck.”</p>

<p>The alarm in Berlin was very great. The citizens were awake
to the consciousness that there was danger; that the city itself
would be assaulted. Great was the consternation in the capital
when minute directions came from Frederick respecting the
course to be pursued in the event of such a calamity, and the
places of refuge to which the royal family should retreat.</p>

<p>On the 26th of April Frederick again wrote to M. Podewils:
“I can understand how you are getting uneasy at Berlin. I have
the most to lose of you all, but I am quiet and prepared for
events. If the Saxons take part in the invasion of Silesia, and
we beat them, I am determined to plunge into Saxony. For great
maladies there need great remedies. Either I will maintain my
all or else lose my all. To me remains only to possess myself
in patience. If all alliances, resources, and negotiations fail, and
all conjunctures go against me, I prefer to perish with honor
rather than lead an inglorious life, deprived of all dignity. My
ambition whispers me that I have done more than another to the
building up of my house, and have played a distinguished part
among the crowned heads of Europe. To maintain myself there
has become, as it were, a personal duty, which I will fulfill at the
expense of my happiness and my life. I have no choice left. I
will maintain my power, or it may go to ruin, and the Prussian
name be buried under it. If the enemy attempt any thing upon
us, we will either beat them, or will all be hewed to pieces for
the sake of our country and the renown of Brandenburg. No
other counsel can I listen to. Perform faithfully the given work
on your side, as I on mine. For the rest, let what you call Providence
decide as it likes. I prepare myself for every event. Fortune
may be kind or be unkind, it shall neither dishearten me
nor uplift me. If I am to perish, let it be with honor, and sword
in hand.”</p>

<p>Frederick was, with great energy, gathering all his resources
for a decisive conflict in his fortresses along the banks of the
Neisse. By almost superhuman exertions he had collected an
army there of about seventy thousand men. The united army
of Austria and Saxony marching upon him amounted to one
hundred thousand regulars, together with uncounted swarms of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
Pandours sweeping around him in all directions, interrupting his
communications and cutting off his supplies.</p>

<p>The mountain range upon the south, which separated Silesia
from the realms of the Queen of Hungary, was three or four
hundred miles long, with some twenty defiles practicable for the
passage of troops. The French minister Valori urged Frederick
to guard these passes. This was impossible; and the self-confidence
of the Prussian king is revealed in his reply: “My friend,
if you wish to catch the mouse, you must not shut the trap, but
leave it open.”</p>

<p>The latter part of May, Frederick, in his head-quarters at
Frankenstein, learned that an Austrian army under Prince
Charles, and a Saxon army under the Duke of Weissenfels, in
columns, by strict count seventy-five thousand strong, had defiled
through the passes of the Giant Mountains, and entered Silesia
near Landshut. Day after day he ascended an eminence, and,
with his glass, anxiously scanned the horizon, to detect signs of
the approach of the foe. On Thursday morning, June 3, an immense
cloud of dust in the distance indicated that the decisive
hour was at hand.</p>

<p>As this magnificent army entered upon the smooth and beautiful
fields of Southern Silesia they shook out their banners, and
with peals of music gave expression to their confidence of victory.
The Austrian officers pitched their tents on a hill near Hohenfriedberg,
where they feasted and drank their wine, while,
during the long and beautiful June afternoon, they watched the
onward sweep of their glittering host. “The Austrian and Saxon
army,” writes an eye-witness, “streamed out all the afternoon,
each regiment or division taking the place appointed it; all the
afternoon, till late in the night, submerging the country as in a
deluge.”</p>

<p>Far away in the east the Austrian officers discerned a Prussian
column of observation, consisting of about twelve thousand
horse and foot, wending along from hollow to height, their polished
weapons flashing back the rays of the afternoon sun.
Frederick, carefully examining the ground, immediately made
arrangements to bring forward his troops under curtain of the
night for a decisive battle. His orderlies were silently dispatched
in all directions. At eight o’clock the whole army was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
motion. His troops were so concentrated that the farthest divisions
had a march of only nine miles. Silently, not a word
being spoken, not a pipe being lighted, and all the baggage being
left behind, they crossed the bridge of the Striegau River,
and, deploying to the right and the left, took position in front
of the slumbering allied troops.</p>

<p>With the first dawn of the morning, the two armies, in close
contact, rushed furiously upon each other. There were seventy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
thousand on the one side, seventy-five thousand on the other.
They faced each other in lines over an undulating plain nearly
ten miles in extent. It is in vain to attempt to give the reader
an adequate idea of the terrible battle which ensued. With
musketry, artillery, gleaming sabres, and rushing horsemen, the
infuriate hosts dashed upon each other. For fifteen hours the
blood-red surges of battle swept to and fro over the plain. At
length Prince Charles, having lost nine thousand in dead and
wounded, seven thousand prisoners, sixteen thousand in all, sixty-six
cannon, seventy-three flags and standards, beat a retreat.
Rapidly his bleeding and exhausted troops marched back
through Hohenfriedberg, entered the mountain defiles, and
sought refuge, a thoroughly beaten army, among the fortresses
of Bohemia. Frederick remained the undisputed victor of the
field. Five thousand of his brave soldiers lay dead or wounded
upon the plain. Even his stoical heart was moved by the greatness
of the victory. As he first caught sight of M. Valori after
the battle, he threw his arms around him, exclaiming, “My friend,
God has helped me wonderfully this day.”</p>

<p>“There was, after all,” says Valori, “at times a kind of devout
feeling in this prince, who possessed such a combination of qualities,
good and bad, that I know not which preponderates.”</p>

<p>The Prussian army was so exhausted by its midnight march
and its long day of battle that his majesty did not deem it wise
to attempt to pursue the retreating foe. For this he has been
severely, we think unjustly, censured by some military men.
He immediately, that evening, wrote to his mother, saying, “So
decisive a defeat has not been since Blenheim,” and assuring her
that the two princes, her sons, who had accompanied him to the
battle, were safe. Such was the battle of Hohenfriedberg, once
of world-wide renown, now almost forgotten.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">The</span> decisive battle of Hohenfriedberg, by which victory
Frederick probably escaped utter destruction, was fought on the
4th of June, 1745. From early dawn to the evening twilight of
the long summer’s day the dreadful work of slaughter had continued
without a moment’s intermission. As the Austrians, having
lost nearly one fourth of their number, retreated, the Prussians,
in utter exhaustion, threw themselves upon the ground for
sleep. The field around them was covered with fourteen thousand
of the wounded, the dying, and the dead.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Frederick commenced the vigorous
pursuit of the retiring foe. A storm arose. For twelve hours
the rain fell in torrents. But the Prussian army was impelled
onward, through the mud, and through the swollen streams, inspired
by the almost supernatural energy which glowed in the
bosom of its king. It seemed as if no hardships, sufferings, or
perils could induce those iron men, who by discipline had been
converted into mere machines, to wander from the ranks or to
falter on the way. As we have mentioned, there were throughout
all this region two religious parties, the Catholics and the
Protestants. They were strongly antagonistic to each other.
Under the Austrian sway, the Catholics, having the support of
the government, had enjoyed unquestioned supremacy. They
had often very cruelly persecuted the Protestants, robbing them
of their churches, and, in their zeal to defend what they deemed
the orthodox faith, depriving them of their children, and placing
them under the care of the Catholic priests to be educated.</p>

<p>“While the battle of Hohenfriedberg was raging,” writes an
eye-witness, “as far as the cannon was heard all around, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
Protestants fell on their knees praying for victory for the Prussians.”
Indescribable was the exultation when the bugle peals
of the Prussian trumpeters announced to them a Protestant victory.
When Frederick approached, in his pursuit, the important
town of Landshut, the following incident occurred, as described
by the pen of his Prussian majesty:</p>

<p>“Upon reaching the neighborhood of Landshut, the king was
surrounded by a troop of two thousand Protestant peasants.
They begged permission of him to massacre the Catholics of
those parts, and clear the country of them altogether. This animosity
arose from the persecutions which the Protestants had
suffered during the Austrian domination.</p>

<p>“The king was very far from granting so barbarous a permission.
He told them they ought rather to conform to the precepts
of Scripture, and to ‘bless those that curse them, and pray
for those that despitefully use them.’ Such, the king assured
them, was the way to gain the kingdom of heaven. The peasants,
after a little reflection, declared that his majesty was right,
and desisted from their cruel intention.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>For several weeks the Austrians slowly and sullenly retired.
Their retreat was conducted in two immense columns, by parallel
roads at some distance from each other. Their wings of foragers
and skirmishers were widely extended, so that the hungry
army swept with desolation a breadth of country reaching out
many leagues. Though the Austrian army was traversing the
friendly territory of Bohemia, still Prince Charles was anxious
to leave behind him no resources for Frederick to glean. Frederick,
with his army, pressed along, following the wide-spread
trail of his foes. The Austrians, with great skill, selected every
commanding position on which to erect their batteries, and hurl
back a storm of shot and shell into the bosoms of their pursuers.
But Frederick allowed them no rest by day or by night. His
solid columns so unremittingly and so impetuously pressed with
shot, bullets, bayonet, and sabre-blows upon the rear ranks of
the foe that there was almost an incessant battle, continuing for
several weeks, crimsoning a path thirty miles wide and more
than a hundred miles in length with the blood of the wounded
and the slain.</p>

    <div class="caption">THE RETREAT OF THE AUSTRIANS.</div></div>

<p>The region through which this retreat and pursuit were conducted
was much of the way along the southern slope of the
Giant Mountains. It was a wild country of precipitous rocks,
quagmires, and gloomy forests. At length Prince Charles, with
his defeated and dispirited army, took refuge at Königsgraft, a
compact town between the Elbe and the Adler, protected by
one stream on the west, and by the other on the south. Here,
in an impregnable position, he intrenched his troops. Frederick,
finding them unassailable, encamped his forces in a position almost
equally impregnable, a few miles west of the Elbe, in the
vicinity of a little village called Chlum. Thus the two hostile
armies, almost within sound of each other’s bugles, defiantly
stood in battle array, each watching an opportunity to strike a
blow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
“War is cruelty,” said General Sherman; “and you can not
refine it.” “No man of refined Christian sensibilities,” said the
Duke of Wellington, “should undertake the profession of a soldier.”
The exigencies of war often require things to be done
from which humanity revolts. “War,” said Napoleon I., “is the
science of barbarians.” One of the principal objects of Frederick
in this pursuit of the Austrians through Bohemia was to lay
waste the country so utterly, destroying its roads and consuming
its provisions, that no Austrian army could again pass through
it for the invasion of Silesia. Who can imagine the amount of
woe thus inflicted upon the innocent peasants of Bohemia?
Both armies were reduced to the necessity of living mainly upon
the resources of the country in which they were encamped.
Their foraging parties were scattered in all directions. There
were frequent attacks of outposts and bloody skirmishes, in
which many were slain and many were crippled for life. Each
death, each wound, sent tears, and often life-long woe, to some
humble cottage.</p>

<p>There are sometimes great and glorious objects to be attained—objects
which elevate and ennoble a nation or a race—which
warrant the expenditure of almost any amount of temporary suffering.
It is not the duty of the millions to suffer the proud
and haughty hundreds to consign them to ignorance and trample
them in the dust. In this wicked world, where kings and
nobles have ever been so ready to doom the masses of the people
to ignorance, servitude, and want, human rights have almost
never made any advances but through the energies of the sword.
Many illustrious generals, who, with saddened hearts, have led
their armies over fields of blood, have been among the most devoted
friends and ornaments of humanity. Their names have
been enshrined in the affections of grateful millions.</p>

<p>But this war, into which the Prussian king had so recklessly
plunged all Europe, was purely a war of personal ambition.
Even Frederick did not pretend that it involved any question
of human rights. Unblushingly he avowed that he drew his
sword and led his hundred thousand peasant-boys upon their
dreadful career of carnage and misery simply that he might enlarge
his territories, gain renown as a conqueror, and make the
world talk about him. It must be a fearful thing to go to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
judgment seat of Christ with such a crime weighing upon the
soul.</p>

<p>War has its jokes and merriment, but the comedies of war
are often more dreadful than the tragedies of peace. Frederick,
in his works, records the following incident, which he narrates
as “slight pleasantry, to relieve the reader’s mind:”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>The Prussians had a detached post at Smirzitz. The little
garrison there was much harassed by lurking bands of Austrians,
who shot their sentries, cut off their supplies, and rendered it almost
certain death to any one who ventured to emerge from the
ramparts. Some inventive genius among the Prussians constructed
a straw man, very like life, representing a sentinel with
his shouldered musket. By a series of ropes this effigy was
made to move from right to left, as if walking his beat. A well-armed
band of Prussians then hid in a thicket near by.</p>

<p>Ere long a company of Austrian scouts approached. From a
distance they eyed the sentinel, moving to and fro as he guarded
his post. A sharp-shooter crept near, and, taking deliberate aim
at his supposed victim, fired. A twitch upon the rope caused
the image to fall flat. The whole band of Austrians, with a
shout, rushed to the spot. The Prussians, from their ambuscade,
opened upon them a deadly fire of bullets. Then, as the ground
was covered with the mutilated and the dead, the Prussians,
causing the welkin to ring with their peals of laughter, rushed
with fixed bayonets upon their entrapped foes. Not a single
Austrian had escaped being struck by a bullet. Those who
were not killed outright were wounded, and were taken captive.
This is one of the “slight pleasantries” of war.</p>

<p>Frederick’s army was now in a state of great destitution. The
region around was so stripped of its resources that it could afford
his foragers no more supplies. It was difficult for him to
fill his baggage-trains even in Silesia, so much had that country
been devastated by war; and wherever any of his supply wagons
appeared, swarms of Austrian dragoons hovered around, attacking
and destroying them. To add to the embarrassments of
the Prussian king, his purse was empty. His subjects could endure
no heavier taxation. All the plate which Frederick William
had accumulated had been converted into coin and expended.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
Even the massive silver balustrades, which were reserved
until a time of need, were melted and gone. He knew not where
to look for a loan. All the nations were involved in ruinous
war. All wished to borrow. None but England had money to
lend; and England was fighting Frederick, and furnishing supplies
for his foes.</p>

<div id="ip_357" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.75em;">
  <img src="images/i_357.jpg" width="460" height="462" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">A SLIGHT PLEASANTRY.</div></div>

<p>The expenses of the war were enormous. Frederick made a
careful estimate, and found that he required at least three hundred
and seventy-five thousand dollars a month. He could not
carry on another campaign with less than four million five hundred
thousand dollars. He had been expecting that Louis XV.,
who in person was in command of the French army on the Rhine,
would send him a re-enforcement of sixty thousand troops to enable
him to crush the forces of Prince Charles. But week after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
week passed, and no re-enforcements came. The French, intent
upon their conquest, were as selfishly pursuing their own interests
on the Rhine as Frederick was pursuing his in Silesia.</p>

<p>The great victory of Fontenoy, gained by the French on the
Rhine, caused boundless exultation throughout France. “The
French,” writes Carlyle, “made immense explosions of rejoicing
over this victory; Voltaire celebrating it in prose and verse to
an amazing degree; the whole nation blazing out over it into
illuminations, arcs of triumph, and universal three times three;
in short, I think nearly the heartiest national huzza, loud, deep,
long-drawn, that the nation ever gave in like case.”</p>

<p>But this victory on the Rhine was of no avail to Frederick in
Bohemia. It did not diminish the hosts which Prince Charles
was gathering against him. It did not add a soldier to his diminished
columns, or supply his exhausted magazines, or replenish
his empty treasury. Louis XV. was so delighted with the
victory that he supposed Frederick would be in sympathy with
him. He immediately dispatched a courier to the Prussian king
with the glad tidings. But Frederick, disappointed, embarrassed,
chagrined, instead of being gratified, was irritated by the news.
He sent back the scornful reply “that a victory upon the Scamander,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
or in the heart of China, would have been just as important
to him.”</p>

<p>Louis XV. felt insulted by this message, and responded in a
similar strain of irritation. Thus the two monarchs were alienated
from each other. Indeed, Frederick had almost as much
cause to be dissatisfied with the French as they had to be dissatisfied
with him. Each of the monarchs was ready to sacrifice
the other if any thing was to be gained thereby.</p>

<p>Frederick was now in such deep pecuniary embarrassment
that he was compelled to humble himself so far as to apply to
the King of France for money. “If your majesty,” he wrote,
“can not furnish me with any re-enforcements, you must, at least,
send me funds to raise additional troops. The smallest possible
sum which will enable me to maintain my position here is three
million dollars.”</p>

<p>Louis XV. wrote a very unsatisfactory letter in reply. He
stated, with many apologies, that his funds were terribly low,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
that he was exceedingly embarrassed, that it was impossible to
send the sum required, but that he would <em>try</em> to furnish him
with a hundred thousand dollars a month.</p>

<p>Frederick was indignant. Scornfully he rejected the proposal,
saying, “Such a paltry sum might with propriety, perhaps, be
offered to a petty duke of Hesse-Darmstadt, but it is not suitable
to make such a proposition to the King of Prussia.”</p>

<p>Poor Valori, the French embassador, was placed in a very embarrassing
situation. The anger of the Prussian king vented itself
upon him. He was in complete disgrace. It was his duty
daily to wait upon Frederick. But the king would seldom
speak to him, or even look upon him; and if he did favor him
with a glance, it was with an expression of scorn.</p>

<p>Frederick was rapidly awaking to the consciousness that Maria
Theresa, whom he had despised as a woman, and a young
wife and mother, and whose territory he thought he could dismember
with impunity, was fully his equal, not only in ability
to raise and direct armies, but also in diplomatic intrigue.
About the middle of August he perceived from his camp in
Chlum that Prince Charles was receiving large re-enforcements
from the south. At the same time, he saw that corps after corps,
principally of Saxon troops, were defiling away by circuitous
roads to the north. It was soon evident that the heroic Maria
Theresa was preparing to send an army into the very heart of
Prussia to attack its capital. This was, indeed, changing the aspect
of the war.</p>

<p>Berlin was almost defenseless. All Saxony was rising in
arms behind Frederick. The invader of Silesia was in danger
of having his own realms invaded and his own capital sacked.
Frederick was thoroughly roused. But he never allowed himself
to appear agitated or anxious. He ordered Leopold, the Old
Dessauer, to march immediately, with all the troops he could
rally, to the frontiers of Saxony. He even found it necessary to
detach to the aid of Leopold some corps from his own enfeebled
forces, now menaced by an Austrian army twice as large as he
could oppose to them.</p>

<p>While affairs were in this posture, the English, eager to crush
their hereditary rivals, the French, were very anxious to detach
the Prussians from the French alliance. The only way to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
this was to induce Maria Theresa to offer terms of peace such as
Frederick would accept. They sent Sir Thomas Robinson to
Schönbrunn to endeavor to accomplish this purpose. He had
an interview with her Hungarian majesty on the 2d of August,
1745. The queen was very dignified and reticent. Silently she
listened to the proposals of Sir Thomas. She then said, with
firmness which left no room for further argument,</p>

<p>“It would be easier for me to make peace with France than
with Prussia. What good could possibly result now from peace
with Prussia? I must have Silesia again. Without Silesia the
imperial sceptre would be but a bauble. Would you have us
sway that sceptre under the guardianship of Prussia? Prince
Charles is now in a condition to fight the Prussians again. Until
after another battle, do not speak to me of peace. You say
that if we make peace with Prussia, Frederick will give his vote
for the grand-duke as emperor. The grand-duke is not so ambitious
of an empty honor as to engage in it under the tutelage
of Prussia. Consider, moreover, is the imperial dignity consistent
with the loss of Silesia? One more battle I demand. Were
I compelled to agree with Frederick to-morrow, I would try him
in a battle to-night.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>On the 13th of September the German Diet met at Frankfort
for the election of emperor. Frederick had determined that the
Grand-duke Francis, husband of the Hungarian queen, should
not be elected. Maria Theresa had outgeneraled him. Francis
was elected. He had seven out of nine of the electoral votes.
Frederick, thus baffled, could only protest. Maria Theresa was
conscious of her triumph. Though the imperial crown was
placed upon the brow of Francis, all Europe knew that the sceptre
was in the hands of his far more able and efficient wife.
Maria Theresa was at Frankfort at the time of the election. She
could not conceal her exultation. She seemed very willing to
have it understood that her amiable husband was but the instrument
of her will. She took the title of empress queen, and
assumed a very lofty carriage toward the princes of the empire.
Alluding to Frederick, she said, in a very imperial tone, for she
deemed him now virtually vanquished,</p>

<p>“His Prussian majesty has unquestionably talent, but what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
a character! He is frivolous in the extreme, and sadly a heretic
in his religious views. He is a dishonorable man, and what a
neighbor he has been! As to Silesia, I would as soon part with
my last garment as part with it.”</p>

<p>Her majesty now wrote to Prince Charles, urging him to engage
immediately in a fight with Frederick. She sent two of
the highest dignitaries of the court to Königgrätz to press forward
immediate action. There was an eminence near by, which
the Austrian officers daily ascended, and from which they could
look directly into the Prussian camp and observe all that was
transpiring there.</p>

<p>The position of Frederick became daily more embarrassing.
His forces were continually decreasing. Re-enforcements were
swelling the ranks of the Austrians. Elated in becoming the
<em>Imperial Army</em>, they grew more bold and annoying, assailing
the Prussian outposts and cutting off their supplies.</p>

<p>On the 18th of September, when the rejoicing Austrians at
Königgrätz were firing salutes, drinking wine, and feasting in
honor of the election of the grand-duke to the imperial dignity,
Frederick, availing himself of the carousal in the camp of his foes,
crossed the Elbe with his whole army, a few miles above Königgrätz,
and commenced his retreat to Silesia. His path led
through a wild, sparsely inhabited country, of precipitous rocks,
hills, mountain torrents, and quagmires. One vast forest spread
along the banks of the Elbe, covering with its gloom an extent
of sixty square miles. A few miserable hamlets were scattered
over this desolate region. The poor inhabitants lived mainly
upon the rye which they raised and the swine which ranged the
forest.</p>

<p>Along the eastern edge of this vast wilderness the army of
Frederick marched for two days. But Hungarian Pandours in
swarms, savage men on their fleet and shaggy horses, were continually
emerging from the paths of the forest, with gleaming
sabres and shrill war-cries, assailing the flank of the Prussian
line wherever there was the slightest exposure. In the vicinity
of the little village of Sohr the king encamped for two days.
The halt seemed necessary to refresh his horses, and to send out
foraging parties to replenish his stores. But the light horsemen
of the foe were so thick around him, so vigilant, and so bold,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
that no baggage train could enter his camp unless protected by
eight thousand foot and three thousand horse.</p>

<p>Just at the break of day of Thursday morning, September 30,
as the king was in his tent, busy with his generals, examining
maps in preparation for the immediate resumption of the march,
an orderly came, in breathless haste, to inform the king that the
Austrians were advancing rapidly upon him, and in great force.
While he was yet speaking another messenger arrived, confirming
the tidings, and stating that, apparently, the whole Austrian
army, in battle array, was coming down upon him.</p>

<p>It was a cold, dreary autumnal morning. The Austrian army,
according to Frederick’s statement, amounted to sixty thousand
men.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> But it was widely dispersed. Many of the cavalry were
scouring the country in all directions, in foraging parties and as
skirmishers. Large bodies had been sent by circuitous roads to
occupy every avenue of retreat. The consolidated army, under
Prince Charles, now advancing to the attack, amounted to thirty-six
thousand men. Frederick had but twenty-six thousand.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>In this hour of peril the genius of the Prussian monarch was
remarkably developed. He manifested not the slightest agitation
or alarm. His plan was immediately formed. Indeed,
there was no time for a moment’s delay. The Austrians had
moved rapidly and silently, concealing their approach by a thick
veil of hussars. They were already in solid columns, confident
of victory, advancing upon the Prussian camp. Frederick was
compelled to form his line of battle under fire of the Austrian
batteries. The discipline of the Prussians was such that this
was done with a recklessness of danger, rapidity, and mechanical
precision which seemed almost miraculous, and which elicited
the admiration of every one who beheld it.</p>

<p>The reader would not be interested in the details of the battle
which ensued. It lasted for five hours. It was, as is every
battle, an indescribable scene of tumult, uproar, and confusion.
The result was long doubtful. Defeat to Frederick would have
been utter ruin. It is wonderful how one determined man can
infuse his spirit into a whole host. Every Prussian seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
have the same desperate valor, and determination to conquer or
to die, which animated his king.</p>

<p>The sun had just risen above the horizon when the conflict
commenced. It reached its meridian. Still the storm of battle
swept the plains and reverberated over the hills. Heights had
been taken and retaken; charges had been made and repelled;
the surges of victory had rolled to and fro; over many leagues
the thunderbolts of battle were thickly flying; bugle peals, cries
of onset, shrieks of the wounded crushed beneath artillery wheels,
blended with the rattle of musketry and the roar of artillery;
riderless horses were flying in all directions; the extended plain
was covered with the wreck and ruin of battle, and every moment
was multiplying the victims of war’s horrid butchery.</p>

<p>At length the Austrians were routed—utterly routed—broken,
dispersed, and driven in wild confusion into the glooms of the
forest. The victory of Frederick was complete. As a warrior,
he was winning the title he so greatly coveted, of Frederick the
Great.</p>

<p>It was a glorious victory. What was the price? Five thousand
six hundred Prussian young men lay in their blood upon
the field, dead or wounded. Six thousand seven hundred young
men from Austrian homes lay by their side, silent in death, or
groaning in anguish, lacerated by the missiles of war.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>Frederick was elated with his victory. He had taken three
thousand three hundred prisoners, twenty-one cannon, and twenty-two
standards. He had added to the renown of his name,
and strengthened his hold upon Silesia.</p>

<p>Prince Charles, as he was leading the main body of his army
to the assault, sent a squadron of his fleet-footed cavalry to burn
the Prussian camp, and to assail the foe in their rear. But the
troops found the camp so rich in treasure that they could not
resist the temptation of stopping to plunder. Thus they did
not make the attack which had been ordered, and which would
probably have resulted in the destruction of the Prussian army.
It is said that when Frederick, in the heat of the battle, was informed
that the Pandours were sacking his camp, he coolly replied,
“So much the better; they will not then interrupt us.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">After</span> the retreat of the Austrians, Frederick returned to his
camp to find it plundered and burned. The semi-barbarian assailants
had also consigned to the flames eight or ten sick Prussians
whom they found there, and several women whom they
caught. “We found the limbs of these poor men and women
lying about,” writes General Lehwald.</p>

<p>The camp was so utterly destroyed that Frederick could not
even obtain pen and ink. He was obliged to write with a pencil.
Not a loaf of bread nor a cup of wine was left for the exhausted
king. The hungry soldiers, after a conflict of five hours,
having had neither breakfast nor dinner, found no refreshments
awaiting them; yet, without a murmur, they smoked their pipes,
drank some spring water, and rejoiced in their great victory.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the king; “it is a cheap price to pay for
escaping an attack from Pandours in the rear, while such a battle
was raging in front.”</p>

<p>Frederick remained at Sohr five days. The country was
scoured in all directions to obtain food for his army. It was
necessary that the troops should be fed, even if the poor inhabitants
starved miserably. No tongue can tell the sufferings
which consequently fell upon the peasantry for leagues around.
Prince Charles, with his shattered army, fell back to Königgrätz,
remorselessly plundering the people by the way. Frederick, ordering
his army to retire to Silesia, returned to Berlin.</p>

<p>The victory of Sohr filled Europe with the renown of Frederick.
Still his peril was great, and the difficulties before him
apparently insurmountable. His treasury was exhausted. His
only ally, France, would furnish him with no money, had no confidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
in him, and was in heart exasperated against him. Not
a single court in Europe expressed any friendship for Frederick.
On the contrary, nearly all would have rejoiced at his downfall.
There seemed to be no end to the campaigns which were opening
before him. Yet Frederick knew not where to obtain the
money to meet the expense even of a single campaign.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, Frederick made indirect but vigorous
exertions to bring the war to a close. “I am ready and
desirous now,” he said, “as at all times, for peace. I will immediately
sheathe the sword if I can be guaranteed the possession
of Silesia.”</p>

<p>“I, too, am anxious for peace,” Maria Theresa replied, “and
will joyfully withdraw my armies if Silesia, of which I have been
robbed, is restored to me.”</p>

<p>Thus his Prussian majesty and the Queen of Hungary met
each other like two icebergs in a stormy sea. The allies were
exasperated, not conquered, by the defeat of Sohr. Maria Theresa,
notwithstanding the severity of winter’s cold, resolved immediately
to send three armies to invade Prussia, and storm Berlin
itself. She hoped to keep the design profoundly secret, so
that Frederick might be taken at unawares. The Swedish envoy
at Dresden spied out the plan, and gave the king warning.
Marshal Grüne was to advance from the Rhine, and enter Brandenburg
from the west. Prince Charles, skirting Western Silesia,
was to march upon Brandenburg from the south. General
Rutowski was to spring upon the Old Dessauer, who was encamped
upon the frontiers of Saxony, overwhelm and crush his
army with superior numbers, and then, forming a junction with
Marshal Brüne, with their united force rush upon Berlin.</p>

<p>Frederick was astounded, alarmed, for a moment overwhelmed,
as these tidings were clearly made known to him. He had
brought all this upon himself. “And yet,” the wretched man
exclaimed, “what a life I lead! This is not living; this is being
killed a thousand times a day!”</p>

<p>This despondency lasted, however, but a moment. Concealing
his emotions, he smoothed his furrowed brow, dressed his face in
smiles, and wrote doggerel verses and jocose letters as if he were
merely a fashionable man of pleasure. At the same time he rallied
all his marvelous energies, and prepared to meet the exigency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
with sagacity and intrepidity rarely surpassed. Orders
were immediately dispatched to the Old Dessauer to marshal an
army to oppose Grüne and Rutowski, while the king hastened
to Silesia to attack Prince Charles. Leopold, though he had
nearly numbered his threescore years and ten, according to Frederick,
was very glad to fight once again before he died. The
veteran general ventured to make some suggestions in reference
to the orders he had received. The king sternly replied,</p>

<p>“When your highness gets armies of your own, you will order
them according to your mind. At present, it must be according
to mine.”</p>

<p>Frederick had an army of thirty-five thousand men at Liegnitz,
in Silesia, under the command of young Leopold. Every
man was a thoroughly trained soldier. The army was in the
best possible condition. At seven o’clock in the morning of November
15, 1745, the king left Berlin at full speed for Liegnitz.
He arrived there the next day, and at once took the command.
“There is great velocity in this young king,” writes Carlyle; “a
panther-like suddenness of spring in him; cunning too, as any
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">felis</i> of them; and with claws as the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">felis leo</i> on occasion.”</p>

<p>Prince Charles was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en route</i> for Berlin—a winter’s march of a
hundred and fifty miles. He was not aware that the King of
Prussia was near him, or that the king was conscious of his bold
design. On Saturday night, November 20, the army of Prince
Charles, forty thousand strong, on its line of march, suspecting
no foe near, was encamped in villages, extending for twenty miles
along the banks of the Queiss, one of the tributaries of the Oder.
Four marches would bring them into Brandenburg. It was the
design of Frederick to fall with his whole force upon the centre
of this line, cut it in two, and then to annihilate the extremities.
Early in the morning of Sunday, the 21st, Frederick put his
troops in motion. He marched rapidly all that day, and Monday,
and Tuesday. In the twilight of Tuesday evening, a dense
fog enveloping the landscape, Frederick, with his concentrated
force, fell impetuously upon a division of the Austrian army encamped
in the village of Hennersdorf.</p>

<p>The assault was as sudden and resistless as the sweep of the
avalanche. The Austrian division was annihilated. Scarcely a
man escaped. This achievement was deemed a very brilliant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
passage of war. It cut the Austrian army in twain and secured
its ruin.</p>

<p>The next morning the Prussian troops, led by their indomitable
king, were early on the march, groping through the thick
mist to find more of the foe. But the blow already given was
decisive. The Austrian army was shattered, demoralized, ruined.
The king could find nothing but broken tumbrils, abandoned
wagons, and the débris of an utterly routed army. Prince
Charles, bewildered by the disaster, had wheeled his columns
around, and fled through the passes of the mountains back to
Bohemia. Five thousand of his troops he left behind in killed
or prisoners.</p>

<p>Frederick was not unduly elated with his victory. He was
still terribly harassed for money. There were campaigns opening
before him, in an unending series, requiring enormous expenditure.
Even many such victories as he had just gained would
only conduct him to irretrievable ruin, unless he could succeed
in conquering a peace. In these dark hours the will of this extraordinary
man remained inflexible. He would not listen to
any propositions for peace which did not guarantee to him Silesia.
Maria Theresa would listen to no terms which did not restore
to her the lost province.</p>

<p>Frederick, in this great emergence, condescended again to write
imploringly to France for pecuniary aid. He received a sarcastic
reply, which exasperated him, and which was couched in such
polite terms that he could not openly resent it. Marshal Grüne,
who was advancing rapidly from the Rhine to Berlin, hearing
of the defeat of his confederates at Hennersdorf, and of the retreat
of Prince Charles, wheeled his columns south for Saxony.
Here he effected a junction with General Rutowski, near Dresden.
Their combined troops intrenched themselves, and stood
on the defensive.</p>

<p>On the 29th of December, the Old Dessauer, with thirty-five
thousand men, crossed the frontiers and entered Saxony. He
marched rapidly upon Leipsic, and seized the town, from which
a division of Rutowski’s army precipitately fled. Leopold found
here quite a supply of commissary and ordnance stores. He also
replenished his empty army-chest by levying a contribution of
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars upon the inhabitants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
Then, by a rapid march northeast to Torgo, on the Elbe, he captured
another imperial magazine. Turning south, he pressed his
troops along up the river to Myssen, which was within two days’
easy march of Dresden. Here there was a bridge across the
Oder. Frederick was pushing his troops, by forced marches,
from Hennersdorf, to effect a junction with Leopold at Myssen.
Unitedly they were to fall upon Grüne and Rutowski at Dresden.
In the mean time, also, Prince Charles, a despondent man,
crushed by domestic woe and humiliating defeats, was moving,
by not very energetic steps, to re-enforce the allied troops at
Dresden.</p>

<p>It was two o’clock in the afternoon of Sunday, December 12,
when the banners of the Old Dessauer appeared before Myssen.
The Saxon commander there broke down the bridge, and in the
darkness of the night stole away with his garrison to Dresden.
Leopold vigorously but cautiously pursued. As the allied army
was near, and in greater force than Leopold’s command, it was
necessary for him to move with much discretion. His march
was along the west bank of the river. The ground was frozen
and white with snow.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning, December 15, the advance-guard of
the Prussians saw before them the allied army, thirty-five thousand
strong, occupying a very formidable position. Marshal
Grüne and General Rutowski had advanced a few miles north
from Dresden to meet the Prussians. Their troops were drawn
up in battle array, extending from the River Elbe on the east,
to the village of Kesselsdorf on the west. A small stream, with
a craggy or broken gully or dell, extended along their whole
front. The southern ridge, facing the advancing Prussians, bristled
with artillery. Some of the pieces were of heavy calibre.
Leopold had only light field-pieces.</p>

<p>In the cold of the winter morning the Old Dessauer carefully
reconnoitred the position of his foes. Their batteries seemed
innumerable, protected by earth-works, and frowning along a cliff
which could only be reached by plunging into a gully and wading
through a half-frozen bog. There was, however, no alternative
but to advance or retreat. He decided to advance.</p>

<p>Forming his army in two parallel lines, nearly five miles long,
facing the foe, he prepared to open the battle along the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
extent of the field. While thus engrossing the attention of the
enemy, his main attempt was to be directed against the village
of Kesselsdorf, which his practiced eye saw to be the key of the
position. It was two o’clock in the afternoon ere all his arrangements
were completed. The Old Dessauer was a devout man—in
his peculiar style a religious man, a man of prayer. He never
went into battle without imploring God’s aid. On this occasion,
all things being arranged, he reverently uncovered his head, and
in presence of the troops offered, it is said, the following prayer:</p>

<p>“O my God, help me yet this once. Let me not be disgraced
in my old days. But if Thou wilt not help me, don’t help those
scoundrels, but leave us to try it out ourselves.”</p>

<p>Having uttered this prayer, he waved his hat to his troops,
and shouted, “On, in God’s name!”</p>

<p>“The Prussians,” writes Carlyle, “tramp on with the usual
grim-browed resolution, foot in front, horse in rear. But they
have a terrible problem at that Kesselsdorf, with its retrenched
batteries and numerous grenadiers fighting under cover. The
very ground is sore against them; up-hill, and the trampled snow
wearing into a slide, so that you sprawl and stagger sadly. Thirty-one
big guns, and near nine thousand small, pouring out mere
death on you from that knoll-head. The Prussians stagger; can
not stand; bend to rightward to get out of shot range; can not
manage it this bout. Rally, re-enforced; try it again. Again
with a will; but again there is not a way. The Prussians are
again repulsed; fall back down this slippery course in more disorder
than the first time. Had the Saxons stood still, steadily
handling arms, how, on such terms, could the Prussians have ever
managed it?”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>At the second repulse, the Saxon grenadiers, greatly elated,
gave a shout of “victory,” and rushed from their works to pursue
the retreating Prussians. This was their ruin.</p>

<p>“Old Leopold, quick as thought, noticing the thing, hurls cavalry
on these victorious, down-plunging grenadiers; slashes them
asunder into mere recoiling whirlpools of ruin, so that few of
them got back unwounded; and the Prussians, storming in along
with them, aided by ever new Prussians, the place was at length
carried.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
And now the Prussians from the centre press the foe with new
vigor. Leopold, at the head of his victorious division, charged
the allied troops in flank, pouring in upon them his resistless
horsemen. Whole regiments were made prisoners. Ere nightfall
of the short December day, the whole allied army, broken
and disordered, was on the retreat back to Dresden. The night
alone protected them from utter ruin. They had lost six thousand
prisoners, and three thousand in killed and wounded.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>Prince Charles had arrived in Dresden the night before. He
heard the roar of the cannonade all the day, but, for some unexplained
reason, did not advance to the support of his friends.
The very unsatisfactory excuse offered was, that his troops were
exhausted by their long march; and that, having been recently
twice beaten by the Prussians, his army would be utterly demoralized
if led to another defeat.</p>

<p>On the evening of Tuesday, the 14th, Frederick, with his advanced
guard, reached Myssen. All the next day, Wednesday,
he was hurrying up his troops from the rear. In the afternoon
he heard the deep booming of the cannon far up the Elbe. In
the evening the sky was ablaze with the glare of the watch-fires
of Leopold’s victorious troops. The next morning Frederick
pressed forward with all haste to join Leopold. Couriers on the
way informed him of the great victory. At Wilsdruf, a few
miles from the field of battle, he met Leopold, who had advanced
in person to meet his king. Frederick dismounted, uncovered
his head, and threw his arms around the Old Dessauer in a
grateful embrace.</p>

<p>Together the king and his sturdy general returned to Kesselsdorf,
and rode over the field of battle, which was still strewn
with the ghastly wrecks of war. Large numbers of the citizens
of Dresden were on the field searching for their lost ones among
the wounded or the dead. The Queen of Poland and her children
remained in the city. Frederick treated them with marked
politeness, and appointed them guards of honor. The King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
of Poland, who, it will be remembered, was also Elector of Saxony,
applied for peace. Frederick replied:</p>

<p>“Guarantee me the possession of Silesia, and pay me seven
hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the expenses of this campaign,
and I will withdraw my army.”</p>

    <div class="caption">FREDERICK AND THE OLD DESSAUER.</div></div>

<p>M. D’Arget, private secretary of the French minister Valori,
gives an interesting account of an interview he held with Frederick
at this time. M. D’Arget was quite a favorite of the king,
who conversed with him with unusual frankness.</p>

<p>“These kind condescensions of his majesty,” writes M. D’Arget,
“emboldened me to represent to him the brilliant position
he now held, and how noble it would be, after being the hero of
Germany, to become the pacificator of Europe.”</p>

<p>“I grant it, my dear D’Arget,” said the king, “but it is too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
dangerous a part to play. A reverse brings me to the edge of
ruin. I know too well the mood of mind I was in the last time
I left Berlin ever to expose myself to it again. If luck had been
against me there, I saw myself a monarch without a throne. A
bad game that. In fine, I wish to be at peace.”</p>

<p>“I represented to him,” continues M. D’Arget, “that the house
of Austria would never, with a tranquil eye, see his house in
possession of Silesia.”</p>

<p>“Those that come after me,” said the king, “will do as they
like. The future is beyond man’s reach. I have acquired; it
is theirs to preserve. I am not in alarm about the Austrians.
They dread my armies—the luck that I have. I am sure of their
sitting quiet for the dozen years or so which may remain to me
of life. There is more for me in the true greatness of laboring
for the happiness of my subjects than in the repose of Europe.
I have put Saxony out of a condition to hurt me. She now
owes me twelve million five hundred thousand dollars. By the
defensive alliance which I form with her, I provide myself a help
against Austria. I would not, henceforth, attack a cat, except to
defend myself. Glory and my interests were the occasion of my
first campaigns. The late emperor’s situation, and my zeal for
France, gave rise to the second. Always since, I have been fighting
for my own hearths—for my very existence. I know the
state I have got into. If I now saw Prince Charles at the gates
of Paris, I would not stir.”</p>

<p>“And would you regard with the same indifference,” M. D’Arget
rejoined, “seeing us at the gates of Vienna?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the king replied. “I swear it to you, D’Arget. In a
word, I want to have some good of my life. What are we, poor
human atoms, to get up projects that cost so much blood!”</p>

<p>On the 25th of December, 1745, the peace of Dresden was
signed. The demands of Frederick were acceded to. Augustus
III. of Saxony, Maria Theresa of Austria, and George II. of England
became parties to the treaty. The next day Frederick attended
sermon in the Protestant church. Monday morning his
army, by slow marches, commenced its return to Brandenburg.
Frederick, highly elated by the wonderful and almost miraculous
change in his affairs, entered his carriage in company with his
two brothers, and drove rapidly toward Berlin. The next day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
at two o’clock in the afternoon, they reached the heath of Britz,
five miles out from the city. Here the king found an immense
concourse of the citizens, who had come on horseback and in
carriages to escort him to his palace. Frederick sat in an open
phaeton, accompanied by the Prince of Prussia and Prince Henry.
The throng was so great that the horses could only proceed
at the slowest pace. The air resounded with shouts of
“Long live Frederick the Great.” The king was especially gracious,
saying to those who eagerly crowded around his carriage
wheels,</p>

<p>“Do not press each other, my children. Take care of yourselves
that the horses may not trample upon you, and that no
accident may happen.”</p>

<p>It was remarked that the whole behavior of the king upon
this occasion exhibited the utmost mildness, gentleness, and affability.
He seemed to be influenced by the most tender regard
for the welfare of the people.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the palace, he stood for a moment upon the
grand stairway, and, surveying the thronging thousands, took
off his hat and saluted them. This gave rise to a burst of applause
louder and heartier than Berlin had ever heard before.
The king disappeared within the palace. Where the poor neglected
queen was at this time we are not informed. There are
no indications that he gave her even a thought.</p>

<p>At six o’clock in the evening the whole city was illuminated.
Frederick entered his carriage, and, attended by his two brothers,
the Prince of Prussia and Prince Henry, rode out to take the
circuit of the streets. But the king had received information
that one of his former preceptors, M. Duhan, lay at the point of
death. He ordered his carriage to be at once driven to the residence
of the dying man. The house of M. Duhan was situated
in a court, blazing with the glow of thousands of lamps.</p>

<p>“It was an affecting sight,” says M. Bielfeld, “to see a dying
man in the midst of a brilliant illumination, surrounded by
princes, and visited by a triumphant monarch, who, in the midst
of the incessant clamor of exultation, sought only to alleviate
the sick man’s pangs, participating in his distress, and reflecting
upon the vanity of all human grandeur.”</p>

<p>The king having taken a tender adieu of M. Duhan, who died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
the next morning, traversed the brilliant streets of the rejoicing
city, and returned to the palace about ten that evening.</p>

<p>Frederick now entered upon a period of ten years of peace.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">“Happy</span> the people,” says Montesquieu, “whose annals are
blank in history books.” The annals of the nations are mainly
composed of wars, tumult, and woe. For ten years Prussia enjoyed
peace. During this happy period, when the days and the
years glided by in tranquillity, there is little left for the historian
to record. Frederick engaged vigorously in repairing the ruins
left by the war. The burned Silesian villages were rebuilt;
debts were paid; agriculture and commerce encouraged; the
laws revised and reformed. A decree was issued that all lawsuits
should be brought to a decision within a year after their
beginning.</p>

<p>The king, weary of the life of turmoil, constructed for himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
a beautiful villa, which he named <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sans Souci</i> (“Free from Care”),
which Carlyle characteristically translates “No bother.” It was
situated on a pleasant hill-top near Potsdam, in great retirement,
yet commanding an enchanting view of land and water.</p>

<p>On the first of May, 1747, Frederick took formal possession of
this beautiful chateau. The occasion was celebrated by quite a
magnificent dinner of two hundred covers. Here, for the next
forty years, he spent most of his leisure time. He had three
other palaces, far surpassing Sans Souci in splendor, which he
occasionally visited on days of royal festivities. Berlin and
Charlottenburg were about twenty miles distant. The New
Palace, so called, at Potsdam, was but about a mile from Sans
Souci. He had also his palace at Rheinsberg, some thirty miles
north of Berlin, where he had spent many of his early days.</p>

    <div class="caption">THE NEW PALACE AT POTSDAM.</div></div>

<p>It is said that one day, as Frederick was contemplating the
royal burying-ground, not far from the spot which he had selected
for his rural villa, he said to a companion by his side, in
reference to his own burial, “Oui, alors je serais sans souci.”
<em>Yes, then I shall be free from care.</em> From that remark the villa
took its name. Frederick adopted it, and inscribed it in golden
letters on the lintel. He appropriated to his private use three
apartments—an audience-room, a library, and a small alcove for
a bedroom. In this alcove, scarcely larger than a closet, he slept,
in soldier style, upon an iron bed, without curtains. An old
slouched hat, softened by wear, served him for a night-cap. His
library was a beautiful room, very richly furnished. There were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
terrible war-clouds still sweeping over various parts of Europe,
but their lightning flashes and their thunder roar disturbed not
the repose of Frederick in his elevated retreat.</p>

<p>In the month of October, 1747, Field-marshal Keith visited his
Prussian majesty at Sans Souci. In a letter to his brother he
thus describes the results of his observations:</p>

<p>“I have now the honor, and, what is still more, the pleasure
of being with the king at Potsdam. I have the honor to dine
and sup with him almost every day. He has more wit than I
have wit to tell you; speaks solidly and knowingly on all kinds
of subjects; and I am much mistaken if, with the experience of
four campaigns, he is not the best officer of his army. He has
several persons with whom he lives with almost the familiarity
of a friend, but he has no favorite. He shows a natural politeness
for every body who is about him. For one who has been
four days about his person, you will say, I pretend to know a
great deal about his character. But what I tell you you may
depend upon. With more time I shall know as much of him as
he will let me know, and no one of his ministry knows any more.”</p>

<p>The king was a very busy man. In addition to carrying on
quite an extensive literary correspondence, he was vigorously
engaged in writing his memoirs. He was also with great energy
developing the wealth of his realms. In the exercise of absolute
power, his government was entirely personal. He had no
constitution to restrain him. Under his single control were concentrated
all legislative, judicial, and executive powers. There
was no senate or legislative corps to co-operate in framing laws.
His ministers were merely servants to do his bidding. The
courts had no powers whatever but such as he intrusted to them.
He could at any time reverse their decrees, and flog the judges
with his cane, or hang them.</p>

<p>Frederick was a great snuff-taker. He always carried two
large snuff-boxes in his pocket. Several others stood upon tables
around in his rooms, always ready for use. The cheapest
of these boxes cost fifteen hundred dollars. He had some richly
studded with gems, which cost seven thousand five hundred dollars.
At his death one hundred and thirty snuff-boxes appeared
in the inventory of his jewels.</p>

<p>Many anecdotes are related illustrative of the kind feelings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
the king toward the peasants. He was much interested in
ameliorating their condition, and said to the Bishop of Varmia,
“Believe me, if I knew every thing—if I could read every thing
myself—all my subjects should be happy. But alas! I am but
a man.”</p>

<p>In the ranks all of the army were equally entitled to distinction.
Promotion was conferred upon merit, not upon the accident
of birth. This principle, which was entirely ignored in the
other European despotisms, probably contributed to the success
of Frederick’s armies. A Hanoverian count wrote to him, soliciting
a high position in the army for his son, in favor of his exalted
birth. Frederick dictated the following reply:</p>

<p>“I am obliged to tell you that I have long forbid <em>counts</em> to be
received, as such, into my army; for when they have served one
or two years they retire, and merely make their short military
career a subject of vain boasting. If your son wishes to serve,
the title of count can be of no use to him. But he will be promoted
if he learn his profession well.”</p>

<p>The king then took the pen himself, and added with his own
hand:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Young counts who have learned nothing are the most ignorant
people in all countries. In England the king’s son begins
by being a sailor on board a ship, in order to learn the manœuvres
belonging to that service. If it should miraculously happen
that a count could be good for any thing, it must be by banishing
all thoughts about his titles and his birth, for these are
only follies. Every thing depends upon personal merit.</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">Frederick.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>The severity of discipline in the Prussian army was dreadful.
The slightest misdemeanor was punished mercilessly. The drill,
exposure, and hardships in the camp made life to the soldier a
scene of constant martyrdom. Desertion was almost impossible.
The only avenue of escape was suicide. In the little garrison at
Potsdam, in ten years, over three hundred, by self-inflicted death,
escaped their miseries. Dr. Zimmerman states that it not unfrequently
happened that a soldier murdered a child, and then came
and gave himself up to justice. They thought that if they committed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
suicide they would be subject to eternal punishment.
But the murdered infant was sure to go to heaven, and the murderer
would have time to repent and make his peace with God.</p>

<p>Baron Trenck, in his memoir, gives an appalling account of
these hardships in the body-guards to which he belonged. In
time of peace there was scarcely an hour which he could command.
The morning drill commenced at four o’clock. The most
complicated and perilous manœuvres were performed. Frederick
considered this the best school for cavalry in the world. They
were compelled to leap trenches, which were continually widened
till many fell in and broke their legs or arms. They were also
compelled to leap hedges, and continue to charge at the highest
possible speed for miles together. Almost daily some were
either killed or wounded. At midday they took fresh horses,
and repeated these toilsome and dangerous labors. Frequently
they would be called from their beds two or three times in one
night, to keep them on the alert. But eight minutes were allowed
the guardsman to present himself on horseback, in his
place, fully equipped. “In one year of peace,” he says, “the
body-guards lost more men and horses than they had in two battles
during the war.”</p>

<p>In 1747 Marshal Saxe visited Potsdam. He witnessed a review
of the guards. In the account of this review given by Algarotti,
he says, “The squadron of guards, which at one time,
drawn up close, exhibited the appearance of a rock, at another
resembled a cloud scattered along the plain. In the charge on
full gallop one horse’s head was not a foot beyond another. The
line was so exactly straight that Euclid himself could not have
found fault with it.”</p>

<p>In September, 1749, Madame Du Châtelet, the “divine Emilie”
of Voltaire, suddenly died. The infidel philosopher seemed
much grieved for a time. Frederick, who never fancied Madame
Du Châtelet, was the more eager, now that she was out of the
way, that Voltaire should come to Sans Souci, and aid him in
his literary labors. A trivial incident occurred at this time
worthy of record, as illustrative of the character of the king.
At the close of the year 1749 there had been a review of Austrian
troops at Mähren. It was not a very important affair, neither
the empress queen nor her husband being present. Three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
Prussian officers made their appearance. It was said that they
had come to inveigle soldiers to desert, and enlist under the
banners of Prussia. They were peremptorily ordered by the
Austrian authorities to leave the ground. Frederick, when he
heard of it, said nothing, but treasured it up.</p>

<p>A few months after, in May, 1750, there was a grand review
at Berlin. An Austrian officer who chanced to be there was invited
by his friend, a Prussian officer, Lieutenant Colonel Chasot,
to attend. The Austrian was not willing to ride upon the parade-ground
without the permission of the king. Colonel Chasot
called upon Frederick and informed him that an Austrian officer
would be happy, with his majesty’s permission, to be present at
the review.</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly,” exclaimed the king.</p>

<p>This was on the evening before the review. On the morrow
the Austrian accordingly rode upon the field. He had hardly
arrived there when, just as the manœuvres were commencing,
one of the aids-de-camp of Frederick galloped up to him and
said, “By the king’s command, sir, you are ordered instantly to
retire from this field.”</p>

<p>Colonel Chasot, exceedingly chagrined, rode directly to the
king, and inquired, “Did not your majesty grant me permission
to invite my friend to the review?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied the king, in his most courteous tones;
“and if he had not come, how could I have paid back the
Mähren business of last year?”</p>

<p>It is pleasant to record another incident more creditable to
Frederick. In the year 1750 there was a poor and aged schoolmaster,
by the name of Linsenbarth, a very worthy man, a veritable
Dominie Sampson, residing in the obscure village of Hemmleben.
He had been educated as a clergyman, had considerable
book learning, was then out of employment, and was in extreme
destitution. The pastor of the village church died, leaving a
vacant pulpit, and a salary amounting to about one hundred dollars
a year. The great man of the place, a feudal lord named
Von Werthern, offered the situation to Linsenbarth upon condition
that he would marry his lady’s termagant waiting-maid.
Linsenbarth, who had no fancy for the haughty shrew, declined
the offer. The lord and lady were much offended, and in various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
ways rendered the situation of the poor schoolmaster so uncomfortable
that he gathered up his slender means, amounting
to about three hundred dollars, all in the deteriorated coin of
the province, and went to Berlin. His money was in a bag containing
nearly nine thousand very small pieces of coin, called
<em>batzen</em>.</p>

<p>At the custom-house the poor man’s coin was seized as contraband.
He was informed that the king, had forbidden the circulation
of that kind of money in Berlin. The heartless officials
laughed at the poor man’s distress, paid no regard to his remonstrances
and pleadings, and locked up his confiscated coin.</p>

<p>Poor Linsenbarth had a feather bed, a small chest of clothes,
and a bag of books. He went to a humble inn, called the
“White Swan,” utterly penniless. The landlord, seeing that he
could levy upon his luggage in case of need, gave him food and
a small room in the garret to sleep in. Here he remained in a
state verging upon despair for eight weeks. Some of the simple
neighbors advised him to go directly to the king, as every poor
man could do at certain hours in the day. He wrote a brief
statement of the facts, and started on foot for Potsdam. We
give the result in the words of Linsenbarth:</p>

<p>“At Potsdam I was lucky enough to see the king. He was
on the esplanade drilling his troops. When the drill was over
he went into the garden, and the soldiers dispersed. Four officers
remained lounging on the esplanade. For fright, I knew
not what to do; I drew the papers from my pocket. These
were my memorial, two certificates of character, and a Thuringian
pass. The officers, noticing this, came directly to me and said,
‘What letters have you there?’ I thankfully imparted the
whole. When the officers had read them, they said, ‘We will
give you good advice. The king is extra gracious to-day, and is
gone alone into the garden. Follow him straight. You will
have luck.’</p>

<p>“This I would not do; my awe was too great. They thereupon
laid hands upon me. One took me by the right arm, another
by the left, and led me to the garden. Having got me
there, they looked out for the king. He was among the gardeners
examining some rare plant, and had his back to us. Here I
had to halt. The officers began in an under tone to put me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
through my drill. ‘Take your hat under your left arm; put
your right foot foremost; breast well forward; hold your head
up; hold your papers aloft in your right hand; there, so—steady—steady!’</p>

    <div class="caption">FREDERICK AND LINSENBARTH.</div></div>

<p>“They then went away, often looking around to see if I kept
my posture. I perceived well enough that they were making
game of me; but I stood all the same like a wall, being full of
fear. When the king turned round he gave a look at me like a
flash of sunbeams glancing through you. He sent one of the
gardeners to bring my papers. Taking them, he disappeared in
one of the garden walks. In a few minutes he came back with
my papers open in his hand, and waved with them for me to
come nearer. I plucked up heart and went directly to him.
Oh, how graciously this great monarch deigned to speak to me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
“‘My good Thuringian,’ said the king, ‘you came to Berlin
seeking to earn your bread by the industrious teaching of children,
and here at the custom-house they have taken your money
from you. True, the <em>batzen</em> are not legal here. They should
have said to you, “You are a stranger and did not know of the
prohibition. We will seal up the bag of <em>batzen</em>. You can send
it back to Thuringia and get it changed for other coin.” Be of
good heart, however. You shall have your money again, and
interest too. But, my poor man, in Berlin they do not give any
thing gratis. You are a stranger. Before you are known and
get to teaching, your bit of money will be all gone. What then?’</p>

<p>“I understood the speech perfectly well, but my awe was too
great to allow me to say, ‘Your majesty will have the grace to
allow me something.’ But as I was so simple, and asked for
nothing, he did not offer any thing. And so he turned away.
But he had gone scarcely six or eight steps when he looked
around and gave me a sign to walk by his side.”</p>

<p>The king then questioned him very closely respecting the
place where he had studied, during what years, under what
teachers, and to what branches he had devoted special attention.
While thus conversing the clock struck twelve. This was the
dinner-hour of his majesty. “Now I must go,” said the king.
“They wait for their soup.”</p>

<p>Linsenbarth, thus left alone, sauntered from the garden back
to the esplanade. There he stood quite bewildered. He had
walked that day twenty miles beneath a July sun and over the
burning sands. He had eaten nothing. He had not a farthing
in his pocket.</p>

<p>“In this tremor of my heart,” writes Linsenbarth, “there came
a valet out of the palace and asked, ‘Where is the man that was
with my king in the garden?’ I answered, ‘Here.’ He led me
into the palace to a large room, where pages, lackeys, and soldier
valets were about. My valet took me to a little table excellently
furnished with soup, beef; likewise carp, dressed with garden
salad; likewise game, with cucumber salad; bread, knife, fork,
plate, spoon were all there. My valet set me a chair, and said,</p>

<p>“‘This that is on the table the king has ordered to be served
for you. You are to eat your fill and mind nobody. I am to
serve.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
“I was greatly astonished, and knew not what to do; least of
all could it come into my head that the king’s valet who waited
on his majesty should wait on me. I pressed him to sit by me;
but, as he refused, I did as bidden.</p>

<p>“The valet took the beef from the table and set it on the charcoal
dish until wanted. He did the like with the fish and roast
game, and poured me out wine and beer. I ate and drank till I
had abundantly enough. Dessert, confectionery, what I could.
A plate of big black cherries and a plateful of pears my waiting-man
wrapped in paper, and stuffed them into my pockets to be
a refreshment on the way home. And so I rose from the royal
table, and thanked God and the king in my heart that I had
so gloriously dined. At that moment a secretary came, brought
me a sealed order for the custom-house at Berlin, with my certificates
and the pass; told down on the table five tail-ducats
and a gold Friedrich under them, saying, ‘The king sent me this
to take me home to Berlin.’<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>“And if the hussar took me into the palace, it was now the
secretary took me out again. And there, yoked with six horses,
stood a royal wagon, which, having led me to, the secretary said,
‘You people, the king has given order that you are to take this
stranger to Berlin, and you are to accept no drink-money from
him.’ I again testified my thankfulness for the royal kindness,
took my place, and rolled away.</p>

<p>“On reaching Berlin I went at once to the custom-house, and
handed them my royal order. The head man opened the seal.
In reading, he changed color—went from pale to red; said nothing,
and gave it to the second man to read. The second put on
his spectacles, read, and gave it to the third. However, the head
man rallied himself at last. I was to come forward and be so
good as to write a receipt that I had received for my four hundred
thalers, all in <em>batzen</em>, the same sum in Brandenburg coin,
ready down, without the least deduction. My cash was at once
accurately paid, and thereupon the steward was ordered to go
with me to the ‘White Swan,’ and pay what I owed there, whatever
my score was. That was what the king had meant when
he said ‘you shall have your money back, and interest too.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
This good old man died in Berlin on the 24th of August,
1777, eighty-eight years of age.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1750 Frederick held a famous Berlin carousal,
the celebrity of which filled all Europe. Distinguished
guests flocked to the city from all the adjoining realms. Wilhelmina
came to share in the festivities. Voltaire was also present,
“the observed of all observers.” An English gentleman, Sir
Jonas Hanway, in the following terms describes the appearance
of Frederick at this time:</p>

<p>“His Prussian majesty rides much about, often at a rapid rate,
with a pleasant business aspect—humane, though imperative;
handsome to look upon, though with a face perceptibly reddish.
His age, now thirty-eight gone; a set appearance, as if already
got into his forties; complexion florid; figure muscular, almost
tending to be plump.”</p>

<p>The carousal presented a very splendid spectacle. It took
place by night, and the spacious arena was lighted by thirty
thousand torches. The esplanade of the palace, which presented
an ample parallelogram, was surrounded by an amphitheatre of
rising seats, crowded with the beauties and dignitaries of Europe.
At one end of the parallelogram was a royal box, tapestried
with the richest hangings. The king sat there; his sister,
the Princess Amelia, was by his side, as queen of the festival.
Where the neglected wife of Frederick was is not recorded. The
entrance for the cavaliers was opposite the throne. The jousting
parties consisted of four bands, representing Romans, Persians,
Carthaginians, and Greeks. They were decorated with splendid
equipments of jewelry, silver helmets, sashes, and housings, and
were mounted on the most spirited battle-steeds which Europe
could furnish. The scene was enlivened by exhilarating music,
and by the most gorgeous decorations and picturesque costumes
which the taste and art of the times could create. The festivities
were closed by a ball in the vast saloons of the palace, and
by a supper, where the tables were loaded with every delicacy.</p>

<p>Voltaire was received on this occasion with very distinguished
honor. The king, in inviting him to the court, had sent him a
sum amounting to three thousand dollars to pay the expenses of
his journey. He had also conferred upon him the cross of the order
of Merit, and a pension of about four thousand dollars a year.</p>

    <div class="caption">TOURNAMENT AT BERLIN IN HONOR OF FREDERICK.</div></div>

<p>For a time Frederick and Voltaire seem to have lived very
pleasantly together. Voltaire writes: “I was lodged under the
king’s apartment, and never left my room except for supper. The
king composed, above stairs, works of philosophy, history, poetry;
and his favorite, below stairs, cultivated the same arts and
the same talents. They communicated to one another their respective
works. The Prussian monarch composed, at this time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
his ‘History of Brandenburg;’ and the French author wrote his
‘Age of Louis XIV.,’ having brought with him all his materials.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
His days thus passed happily in a repose which was only animated
by agreeable occupations. Nothing, indeed, could be more
delightful than this way of life, or more honorable to philosophy
and literature.”</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">The</span> king and Voltaire soon became involved in a very serious
quarrel. Voltaire had employed a Jew, by the name of Hirsch,
to engage fraudulently in speculating in the funds. The transaction
was so complicated that few of our readers would have
the patience to follow an attempt at its disentanglement. Voltaire
and his agent quarreled. The contention rang through
all the court circles, as other conspicuous names were involved
in the meshes of the intrigue. A lawsuit ensued, which created
excitement almost inconceivable. The recent law reform caused
the process to be pushed very rapidly to its conclusion. Voltaire
emerged from the suit with his character sadly maimed.
He was clearly convicted of both falsehood and forgery. The
king, annoyed by the clamor, retired from Berlin to Sans Souci.
Voltaire was not invited to accompany him, but was left in the
Berlin palace. In a letter which Frederick wrote to D’Arget,
dated April, 1752, he says:</p>

<p>“Voltaire has conducted himself like a blackguard and a consummate
rascal. I have talked to him as he deserved. He is a
sad fellow. I am quite ashamed for human abilities that a man
who has so much of them should be so full of wickedness. I
am not surprised that people talk at Paris of the quarrel of our
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beaux esprits</i>. Voltaire is the most mischievous madman I ever
knew. He is only good to read. It is impossible for you to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
imagine the duplicities, the impositions, the infamies he practiced
here. I am quite indignant that so much talent and acquirement
do not make men better. I took the part of Maupertuis
because he is a good sort of man, and the other had determined
upon ruining him. A little too much vanity had rendered him
too sensitive to the manœuvres of this monkey, whom he ought
to have despised after having castigated him.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>Frederick wrote to Wilhelmina: “Voltaire picks Jews’ pockets,
but he will get out of it by some somersault.”</p>

<p>Voltaire fell sick. He had already quarreled with many persons,
and had constrained the king in many cases, very reluctantly,
to take his part. He now wrote to Frederick, begging permission
to join him in the quietude of Sans Souci. The following
extracts from the reply of his majesty will be read with interest:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I was glad to receive you in my house. I esteemed your
genius, your talents, and your acquirements. I had reason to
think that a man of your age, weary of fencing against authors,
and exposing himself to the storm, came hither to take refuge, as
in a safe harbor.”</p></blockquote>

<p>After briefly alluding to the many quarrels in which Voltaire
had been involved, the king adds:</p>

<p>“You have had the most villainous affair with a Jew. It has
made a frightful scandal all over town. For my own part, I
have preserved peace in my house until your arrival; and I
warn you that, if you have the passion of intriguing and cabaling,
you have applied to the wrong person. I like peaceable,
quiet people, who do not put into their conduct the violent passions
of tragedy. In case you can resolve to live like a philosopher,
I shall be glad to see you. But if you abandon yourself
to all the violence of your passions, and get into quarrels with
all the world, you will do me no good by coming hither, and
you may as well stay in Berlin.”</p>

<p>Four days after this Frederick wrote again, in answer to additional
applications from Voltaire.</p>

<p>“If you wish to come hither you can. I hear nothing of lawsuits,
not even of yours. Since you have gained it I congratulate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
you, and I am glad that this scurvy affair is done.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> I hope
you will have no more quarrels, either with the Old or the New
Testament. Such contentions leave their mark upon a man.
Even with the talents of the finest genius in France, you will
not cover the stains which this conduct will fasten on your reputation
in the long run. I write this letter with the rough common
sense of a German, without employing equivocal terms
which disfigure the truth. It is for you to profit by it.”</p>

<p>Voltaire’s visit lasted about thirty-two months. He was,
however, during all this time, fast losing favor with the king.
Instead of being received as an inmate at Sans Souci, he was assigned
to a small country house in the vicinity, called the Marquisat.
His wants were, however, all abundantly provided for
at the expense of the king. It is evident from his letters that
he was a very unhappy man. He was infirm in health, irascible,
discontented, crabbed; suspecting every one of being his enemy,
jealous of his companions, and with a diseased mind, crowded
with superstitious fears.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when the king had sent him a manuscript to
revise, he sarcastically exclaimed to the royal messenger, “When
will his majesty be done with sending me his dirty linen to
wash?” This speech was repeated to the king. He did not lose
his revenge.</p>

<p>Frederick was endowed with brilliant powers of conversation.
He was fond of society, where he could exercise and display
these gifts and accomplishments. Frequent suppers were given
at Sans Souci, which lasted from half past eight till midnight.
Gentlemen only—learned men—were invited to these entertainments.
Frederick was not an amiable man. He took pleasure
in inflicting the keenest pain possible with his satirical tongue.
No friend was spared. The more deeply he could strike the lash
into the quivering nerves of sensibility, the better he seemed
pleased with himself.</p>

<p>He could not but respect his wife. Her character was beyond
all possible reproach. She never uttered a complaint, was cheerful
and faithful in every duty. She had rooms assigned her on
the second floor of the Berlin palace, where she was comfortably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
lodged and fed, and had modest receptions every Thursday,
which were always closed at nine o’clock. A gentleman writes
from Berlin at this time:</p>

<p>“The king esteems his wife, and can not endure her. It was
but a few days ago she handed him a letter petitioning for some
things of which she had the most pressing want. Frederick
took the letter with that most smiling, gracious air, which he assumes
at pleasure, and, without breaking the seal, tore it up before
her face, made her a profound bow, and turned his back on
her.”</p>

<p>“The king respects his mother,” the same writer adds. “She
is the only female to whom he pays any sort of attention. She
is a good, fat woman, who moves about in her own way.”</p>

<p>It was a peculiarity quite inexplicable which led Frederick to
exclude females from his court. His favorites were all men—men
of some peculiar intellectual ability. He sought their society
only. With the exception of his sister, and occasionally
some foreign princess, ladies were seldom admitted to companionship
with him. He was a cold, solitary man, so self-reliant
that he seldom asked or took advice.</p>

<p>Voltaire hated M. Maupertuis. He was the president of the
Berlin Academy, and was regarded by Voltaire as a formidable
rival. This hatred gave rise to a quarrel between Frederick and
Voltaire, which was so virulent that Europe was filled with the
noise of their bickerings. M. Maupertuis had published a pamphlet,
in which he assumed to have made some important discovery
upon the law of action. M. König, a member of the
Academy, reviewed the pamphlet, asserting not only that the
proclaimed law was false, but that it had been promulgated half
a century before. In support of his position he quoted from a
letter of Leibnitz. The original of the letter could not be produced.
M. König was accused of having forged the extract.
M. Maupertuis, a very jealous, irritable man, by his powerful influence
as president, caused M. König to be expelled from the
Academy.</p>

<p>Frederick regarded the Academy as his pet institution, and
was very jealous of the illustrious philosopher, whom he had invited
to Berlin to preside over its deliberations. Voltaire,
knowing this very well, and fully aware that to strike the Academy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
in the person of its president was to strike Frederick, wrote
an anonymous communication to a review published in Paris, in
which he accused M. Maupertuis—first, of plagiarism, in appropriating
to himself a discovery made by another; secondly, of a
ridiculous blunder in assuming that said discovery was a philosophical
principle, and not an absurdity; and thirdly, that he
had abused his position as president of the Academy in suppressing
free discussion, by expelling from the institution a member
merely for not agreeing with him in opinion. These statements
were probably true, and on that account the more damaging.</p>

<p>The authorship of the article could not be concealed. Frederick
was indignant. He angrily seized his pen, and wrote a reply,
which, though anonymous, was known by all to have been
written by the king. In this reply he accused the writer of the
article, whom he well knew to be Voltaire, of being a “manifest
retailer of lies,” “a concocter of stupid libels,” and as “guilty of
conduct more malicious, more dastardly, more infamous” than he
had ever known before.</p>

<p>This roused Voltaire. He did not venture to attack the king,
but he assailed M. Maupertuis again, anonymously, but with
greatly increased venom. A brief pamphlet appeared, entitled,
“The Diatribe of Doctor Akakia, Physician to the Pope.” It
was a merciless satire against M. Maupertuis. Voltaire was entirely
unscrupulous, and was perfect master of the language of
sarcasm. No moral principle restrained him from exaggerating,
misrepresenting, or fabricating any falsehoods which would subserve
his purpose. M. Maupertuis was utterly overwhelmed
with ridicule. The satire was so keen that few could read it
without roars of laughter. Voltaire, the king’s guest, was thus
exposing to the contempt of all Europe the president of the Berlin
Academy, the reputation of which Academy was dear to the
king above almost every thing else. An edition of the pamphlet
was printed in Holland, and copies were scattered all over Berlin.
Another edition was published in Paris, where thirty thousand
copies were eagerly purchased.</p>

<p>Frederick was in a towering passion. Voltaire was alarmed
at the commotion he had created. He wrote a letter to the king,
in which he declared most solemnly that he had not intended to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
have the pamphlet published; that a copy had been obtained
by treachery, and had been printed without his consent or
knowledge. But the king wrote back:</p>

<p>“Your effrontery astonishes me. What you have done is clear
as the day; and yet, instead of confessing your culpability, you
persist in denying it. Do you think you can make people believe
that black is white? All shall be made public. Then it
will be seen whether, if your words deserve statues, your conduct
does not deserve chains.”</p>

<p>The king, in his anger, ordered all the pamphlets in Berlin to
be collected and burned by the common hangman, in front of
Voltaire’s windows. Three months passed away, during which
the parties remained in this deplorable state of antagonism.
Voltaire was wretched, often confined to his bed, and looked like
a skeleton. He was anxious to leave Berlin, but feared that the
king would not grant him leave. He wrote to Frederick, stating
that he was very sick, and wished to retire to the springs of
Plombières for his health. The king curtly replied,</p>

<p>“There was no need of that pretext about the waters of Plombières
in demanding your leave. You can quit my service when
you like. But, before going, be so good as to return me the key,
the cross, and the volume of verses which I confided to you.</p>

<p>“I wish that my works, and only they, had been what König
attacked. I could sacrifice them with a great deal of willingness
to persons who think of increasing their own reputation by lessening
that of others. I have not the folly nor vanity of certain
authors. The cabals of literary people seem to me the disgrace
of literature. I do not the less esteem the honorable cultivators
of literature. It is the cabalers and their leaders that are degraded
in my eyes.”</p>

<p>For some unexplained reason, soon after this, the king partially
relented, and invited Voltaire to Potsdam. He allowed him
to retain his cross and key, and said nothing about the return
of the volume of poetry. This was a volume of which twelve
copies only had been printed. On the 25th of March, 1753, Voltaire
left Potsdam for Dresden.</p>

<p>In the following terms Thiebault describes their parting: The
final interview between Frederick and Voltaire took place on
the parade at Potsdam, where the king was then occupied with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
his soldiers. One of the attendants announced Voltaire to his
majesty with these words:</p>

<p>“Sire, here is Monsieur De Voltaire, who is come to receive the
orders of your majesty.”</p>

<p>Frederick turned to Voltaire and said, “Monsieur De Voltaire,
are you still determined upon going?”</p>

<p>“Sire, affairs which I can not neglect, and, above all, the state
of my health, oblige me to it.”</p>

<p>“In that case, sir,” replied the king, “I wish you a good journey.”</p>

<p>Thus parted these remarkable men, who were never destined
to meet again.</p>

<p>Voltaire, being safe out of Prussia, in the territory of the King
of Poland, instead of hastening to Plombières, tarried in Dresden,
and then in Leipsic. From those places he began shooting,
through magazines, newspapers, and various other instrumentalities,
his poisoned darts at M. Maupertuis. Though these malignant
assaults, rapidly following each other, were anonymous, no
one could doubt their authorship. M. Maupertuis, exasperated,
wrote to him from Berlin on the 7th of April:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“If it be true that you design to attack me again, I declare to
you that I have still health enough to find you, wherever you
are, and to take the most signal vengeance upon you. Thank
the respect and obedience which have hitherto restrained my
arm, and saved you from the worst adventure you have ever
had.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Maupertuis.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Voltaire replied from Leipsic:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">M. le President</span>,—I have had the honor to receive your letter.
You inform me that you are well, and that, if I publish La
Beaumelle’s letter,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> you will come and assassinate me. What ingratitude
to your poor Doctor Akakia! If you exalt your soul
so as to discern futurity, you will see that, if you come on that
errand to Leipsic, where you are no better liked than in other
places, you will run some risk of being hanged. Poor me, indeed,
you will find in bed. But, as soon as I have gained a little
strength, I will have my pistols charged, and, multiplying the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
mass by the square of velocity, so as to reduce the action and
you to zero, I will put some lead into your head. It appears
that you have need of it. Adieu, my president.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Akakia.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>There were some gross vulgarities in Voltaire’s letter which
we refrain from quoting. Both of these communications were
printed and widely circulated, exciting throughout Europe contempt
and derision. Voltaire had still the copy of the king’s private
poems. Frederick, quite irritated, and not knowing what
infamous use Voltaire might make of the volume, which contained
some very severe satires against prominent persons, and
particularly against his uncle, the King of England, determined,
at all hazards, to recover the book. He knew it would be of no
avail to write to Voltaire to return it.</p>

<p>Voltaire, on his journey to Paris, would pass through Frankfort.
Frederick secretly employed a Prussian officer to obtain
from the authorities there the necessary powers, and to arrest
him, and take from him the cross of Merit, the gold key of the
chamberlain, and especially the volume of poems. The officer,
M. Freytag, kept himself minutely informed of Voltaire’s movements.
At eight o’clock in the evening of the 31st of May the illustrious
philosopher arrived, with a small suite, traveling in considerable
state, and stopped at the “Golden Lion.” M. Freytag
was on the spot. He was a man of distinction. He called upon
Voltaire, and, after the interchange of the customary civilities,
informed the poet that he was under the necessity of arresting
him in the name of the King of Prussia, and detaining him until
he should surrender the cross, the key, and the volume of poems.
Voltaire was greatly annoyed. He professed warm friendship
for the King of Prussia. Very reluctantly, and not until after
several hours of altercation, he surrendered the key and the cross.
The volume of poems he was very anxious indeed to retain, and
affirmed that they were, he knew not where, with luggage he
had left behind him in Leipsic or Dresden. He was informed
that he would be detained as a prisoner until the volume was
produced.</p>

<p>In a state of great exasperation, Voltaire wrote for a large trunk
to be sent to him which contained the book. To save himself
from the humiliation of being guarded as a prisoner, he gave his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">parole d’honneur</i> that he would not go beyond the garden of
the inn. After a delay of three weeks, Voltaire decided, notwithstanding
his parole, to attempt his escape. His reputation was
such that M. Freytag had no confidence in his word, and employed
spies to watch his every movement.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June, Voltaire dressed himself in disguise, and,
with a companion, M. Coligny, entered a hackney-coach, and ordered
the driver to leave the city by the main gate. M. Freytag
was immediately informed of this by his spies. With mounted
men he commenced the pursuit, overtook the carriage as it was
delayed a moment at the gate, and arrested the fugitive in the
king’s name. Voltaire’s eyes sparkled with fury, and he raved
insanely. The scene gathered a crowd, and Voltaire was taken
by a guard of soldiers to another inn, “The Billy-Goat,” as the
landlord of the “Golden Lion” refused any longer to entertain so
troublesome a guest.</p>

<p>All Frankfort was excited by these events. The renown of
Voltaire as a philosopher, a poet, and as the friend of Frederick,
filled Europe. His eccentricities were the subject of general remark.
The most distinguished men, by birth and culture, had
paid him marked attention during his brief compulsory sojourn
in Frankfort. Having arrived at “The Billy-Goat,” his conduct,
according to the report of M. Freytag, was that of a madman, in
which attempted flight, feigned vomitings, and a cocked pistol
took part. The account which Voltaire gave of these events is
now universally pronounced to be grossly inaccurate.</p>

<p>On the 6th of July, the trunk having arrived, the volume of
poems was recovered and Voltaire was allowed to go on his way.
His pen, dipped in gall, was an instrument which even a monarch
might fear. It inflicted wounds upon the reputation of Frederick
which will probably never be healed. Four years passed
away, during which Voltaire and Frederick were almost entirely
strangers to each other.</p>

<p>The merciless satires of Voltaire, exposing Maupertuis to the
ridicule of all Europe, proved death-blows to the sensitive philosopher.
He was thrown into a state of great dejection, which
induced disease, of which he died in 1759. Maupertuis needed
this discipline. In the proud days of prosperity he had rejected
Christianity. In these hours of adversity, oppressed by humiliation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
and pain, and with the grave opening before him, he felt the
need of the consolations of religion. Christian faith cheered the
sadness of his dying hours.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p>The Marquis D’Argens, another of Frederick’s infidel companions,
one whom Voltaire described as “the most frank atheist in
Europe,” after a very ignoble life of sin and shame, having quarreled
with the king, found himself aged, poor, friendless, and infirm.
He then, experiencing need of different support from any
which infidelity could give, became penitent and prayerful. Renouncing
his unbelief, he became an openly avowed disciple of
Jesus.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>What effect was produced upon the mind of Frederick as he
saw one after another of his boon companions in infidelity, in their
hours of sickness and approaching death, seeking the consolations
of religion, we do not know. The proud king kept his lips
hermetically sealed upon that subject. Voltaire, describing the
suppers of the gay revelers at Sans Souci, writes:</p>

<p>“Never was there a place in the world where liberty of speech
was so fully indulged, or where the various superstitions of men
were treated with so much ridicule and contempt. God was respected.
But those who, in His name, had imposed on mankind,
were not spared. Neither women nor priests ever entered the
palace. In a word, Frederick lived without a court, without a
council, and without a religion.”</p>

<p>Prussia had enjoyed eight years of peace. But Frederick was
not a popular man excepting with his own subjects. They idolized
him. Innumerable are the anecdotes related illustrative of
his kindness to them. He seemed to be earnestly seeking their
welfare. But foreign courts feared him. Many hated him. He
was unscrupulous and grasping, and had but very little sense of
moral integrity. He was ambitious of literary renown; of reputation
as a keen satirist. With both pen and tongue he was
prone to lash without mercy his brother sovereigns, and even
the courtiers who surrounded him. There were no ties of friendship
which could exempt any one from his sarcasm. Other sovereigns
felt that he was continually on the watch to enlarge his
realms, by invading their territories, as he had robbed Maria
Theresa of the province of Silesia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
Some years before this time Frederick had taken possession
of East Friesland, and had made Emden a port of entry. It was
a very important acquisition, as it opened to Prussia a convenient
avenue for maritime commerce. With great vigor and sagacity
Frederick was encouraging this commerce, thus strengthening
his kingdom and enriching his subjects. England, mistress of
the seas, and then, as usual, at war with France, was covering all
the adjacent waters with her war-ships and privateers. Frederick
had inquired of the English court, through his embassador
at London, whether hemp, flax, or timber were deemed contraband.
“<em>No</em>,” was the official response. Freighted with such
merchandise, the Prussian ships freely sailed in all directions.
But soon an English privateer seized several of them, upon the
assumption that the <em>planks</em> with which they were loaded were
contraband.</p>

<p>It was an outrage to which Frederick was not disposed to submit.
He entered his remonstrances. The question was referred
to the British Court of Admiralty. Month after month the decision
was delayed. Frederick lost all patience. English capitalists
held Silesian bonds to the amount of about one million
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>“I must have my ships back again,” said Frederick to the
British court. “The law’s delay in England is, I perceive, very
considerable. My people, who have had their property thus
wrested from them, can not conveniently wait. I shall indemnify
them from the money due on the Silesian bonds, and shall
give England credit for the same. Until restitution is made, I
shall not pay either principle or interest on those bonds.”</p>

<p>The British court was frantic with rage. Frederick had a
strong army on the frontiers of Hanover. The first hostile gun
fired would be the signal for the invasion of that province, and
it would inevitably be wrested from the British crown. The
lion roared, but did not venture to use either teeth or claws.
England was promptly brought to terms. It was grandly done
of Frederick. There was something truly sublime in the quiet,
noiseless, apparently almost indifferent air with which Frederick
accomplished his purpose.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa was more and more unreconciled to the loss of
Silesia. Never for an hour did she relinquish the idea of eventually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
regaining the province. The various treaties into which
she had been compelled to enter she regarded as merely temporary
arrangements. Between the years 1752 and 1755 the energetic
and persistent queen was making secret arrangements for
the renewal of the Silesian war.</p>

<p>The King of Poland, who was also Elector of Saxony, had
strong feelings of personal hostility to Frederick. His prime
minister, Count Von Brühl, even surpassed his royal master in
the bitter antagonism with which he regarded the Prussian
monarch. Frederick, whose eagle eye was ever open, and whose
restless mind was always on the alert, suspected that a coalition
was about to be formed against him. He had false keys made
to the royal archives at Dresden; bribed one of the officials
there, M. Menzel, stealthily to enter the chamber of the archives,
and copy for him such extracts as would throw any light upon
the designs of the court. Among other items of intelligence, he
found that Austria, Russia, and Poland were deliberating upon
the terms of a coalition against him.</p>

<p>On the 15th of May, 1753, the Russian Senate had passed the
resolution that it should henceforth be the policy of Russia not
only to resist all further encroachments on the part of Prussia,
but to seize the first opportunity to force the Prussian monarch
back to the possession of simply his original boundary of Brandenburg.
It was also agreed that, should Prussia attack any of
the allies of Russia, or be attacked by any of them, the armies
of the czar should immediately array themselves against the
armies of Frederick. There were many other papers, more or
less obscure, which rendered it very certain that Maria Theresa
would ere long make a new attempt to regain Silesia, and that
in that attempt she would be aided both by Russia and Poland.
Frederick also knew full well that nothing would better please
his uncle George II. of England than to see Prussia crowded
back to her smallest limits. To add to Frederick’s embarrassment,
France was hopelessly alienated from him.</p>

<p>Many bitter words had already passed between Louis XV.
and Frederick. But recently a new element of discord had appeared.
The Duchess of Pompadour, the guilty favorite of Louis
XV., beautiful, fascinating, and wicked, had become a power in
Europe, notwithstanding the ignoble position she occupied.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
This artful and enchanting woman, having the weak king completely
under her control, was in reality the ruler of France.
The proudest nobles and the highest ecclesiastics bowed submissively
at her shrine. Even the immaculate Maria Theresa, constrained
by state policy, wrote flattering notes to her, addressing
her as “my cousin,” “princess and cousin,” “madame, my dearest
sister.”</p>

<p>The pampered duchess sent by the French minister to Berlin
a complimentary message to Frederick. He disdainfully replied:
“The Duchess of Pompadour! who is she? I do not know her.”
This was an offense never to be forgiven.</p>

<p>Frederick was now in imminent danger of being assailed by a
coalition of Austria, Russia, Poland, and England. Indeed, it
was by no means certain that France might not also join the alliance.
All this was the result of Frederick’s great crime in
wresting Silesia from Austria. Such was the posture of affairs
when, in the summer of 1755, Frederick decided to take a trip
into Holland incognito. He disguised himself with a black wig,
and assumed the character of a musician of the King of Poland.
At Amsterdam he embarked for Utrecht in the common passage-boat.
The king mingled with the other passengers without any
one suspecting his rank. There chanced to be in the boat a
young Swiss gentleman, Henry de Catt, twenty-seven years of
age. He was a teacher, taking a short tour for recreation. He
gives the following account of his interview with the king, whom,
at the time, he had no reason to suppose was other than an ordinary
passenger. We give the narrative in his own words:</p>

<p>“As I could not get into the cabin, because it was all engaged,
I staid with the other passengers in the steerage, and the weather
being fine, came upon deck. After some time there stepped out
of the cabin a man in cinnamon-colored coat with gold buttons;
in black wig; face and coat considerably dusted with Spanish
snuff. He looked at me fixedly for a while, and then said,
without farther preface, ‘Who are you, sir?’ This cavalier tone
from an unknown person, whose exterior indicated nothing very
important, did not please me, and I declined satisfying his curiosity.
He was silent. But some time after he assumed a more
courteous tone, and said, ‘Come in here to me, sir. You will be
better here than in the steerage amidst the tobacco-smoke.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
“This polite address put an end to all anger; and, as the singular
manner of the man excited my curiosity, I took advantage
of the invitation. We sat down and began to speak confidentially
with one another.</p>

<p>“‘Do you see the man in the garden yonder, sitting, smoking
his pipe?’ said he to me. ‘That man, you may depend upon it,
is not happy.’</p>

<p>“‘I know not,’ I answered; ‘but it seems to me, until one
knows a man, and is completely acquainted with his situation
and his way of thought, one can not possibly determine whether
he is happy or unhappy.’</p>

<p>“My gentleman admitted this, and led the conversation on to
the Dutch government. He criticised it—probably to bring me
to speak. I did speak, and gave him frankly to know that he
was not perfectly instructed in the thing he was criticising.</p>

<p>“‘You are right,’ answered he; ‘one can only criticise what
one is thoroughly acquainted with.’</p>

<p>“He now began to speak of religion; and, with eloquent
tongue, to recount what mischiefs scholastic philosophy had
brought upon the world; then tried to prove that creation was
impossible.</p>

<p>“At this last point I stood out in opposition. ‘But how can
one create something out of nothing?’ said he.</p>

<p>“‘That is not the question,’ I answered. ‘The question is,
whether such a being as God can, or can not, give existence to
what, as yet, has none.’</p>

<p>“He seemed embarrassed, and added, ‘But the universe is
eternal.’</p>

<p>“‘You are in a circle,’ said I. ‘How will you get out of it?’</p>

<p>“‘I skip over it,’ he replied, laughing; and then began to talk
of other things. He inquired,</p>

<p>“‘What form of government do you reckon the best?’</p>

<p>“‘The monarchic, if the king is just and enlightened.’</p>

<p>“‘Very well,’ said he; ‘but where will you find kings of that
sort?’ And thereupon went into such a sally as could not in
the least lead me to suppose that he was one. In the end, he
expressed pity for them, that they could not know the sweets of
friendship, and cited on the occasion these verses—his own, I

<p>“‘I have not the honor to be acquainted with kings,’ said I;
‘but, to judge from what one has read in history of several of
them, I should believe, sir, on the whole, that you are right.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah! yes, yes,’ he added, ‘I’m right. I know the gentlemen.’</p>

<p>“A droll incident happened during our dialogue. My gentleman
wanted to let down a little sash window, and could not
manage it. ‘You do not understand that,’ said I; ‘let me do it.’
I tried to get it down, but succeeded no better than he.</p>

<p>“‘Sir,’ said he, ‘allow me to remark, on my side, that you understand
as little of it as I.’</p>

<p>“‘That is true,’ I replied, ‘and I beg your pardon. I was too
rash in accusing you of a want of expertness.’</p>

<p>“‘Were you ever in Germany?’ he now asked me.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ I answered; ‘but I should like to make that journey.
I am very curious to see the Prussian states and their king, of
whom one hears so much.’ And now I began to launch out on
Frederick’s actions.</p>

<p>“But he interrupted me hastily with the word, ‘Nothing more
of kings, sir—nothing more. What have we to do with them?
We will spend the rest of our voyage on more agreeable and
cheering objects.’ And now he spoke of the best of all possible
worlds, and maintained that in our planet, earth, there was more
evil than good. I maintained the contrary, and this discussion
brought us to the end of the voyage.</p>

<p>“On quitting me he said, ‘I hope, sir, you will leave me your
name. I am very glad to have made your acquaintance. Perhaps
we shall see one another again.’ I replied as was fitting to
the compliment, and begged him to excuse me for having contradicted
him a little. I then told him my name, and we parted.”</p>

<p>How soon Henry learned that he had been conversing with
the King of Prussia we do not know. It is evident that Frederick
was pleased with the interview. He soon after invited
Henry de Catt to his court, and appointed him reader to the
king. In this capacity he served his Prussian majesty for about
twenty years. He left a note-book in the royal archives of Berlin
from which the above extracts are taken.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">We</span> now enter upon the third Silesian war, usually termed in
history The Seven Years’ War. For four years Frederick had
been aware that a coalition was secretly forming against him.
Maria Theresa wished, with ardor which had never for one moment
abated, to regain Silesia. All the other European powers,
without exception, desired to curb Frederick, whose ambition
they feared. They were well aware that he was taking advantage
of a few years of peace to replenish his treasury, and to enlarge
his army for new conquests. As we have before stated,
Frederick, by bribery, had fully informed himself of the secret
arrangements into which Austria, Russia, Poland, and other powers
were entering for the dismemberment of his realms. It is in
vain to attempt to unravel the intricacies of the diplomacy which
ensued.</p>

<p>England, while endeavoring to subsidize Russia against Frederick,
entered secretly into a sort of alliance with Frederick, hoping
thus to save Hanover. The Empress Elizabeth, of Russia,
heartily united with Maria Theresa against Frederick, whom she
personally disliked, and whose encroachments she dreaded. His
Prussian majesty, proud of his powers of sarcasm, in his poems
spared neither friend nor foe. He had written some very severe
things against the Russian empress, which had reached her ears.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
Frederick was in great perplexity. To wait for his enemies
to complete their arrangements, and to commence the attack at
their leisure, placed him at great disadvantage. To begin the
attack himself, and thus to open anew the floodgates of war,
would increase the hostility with which the nations were regarding
him. As the diplomacy of the foreign cabinets had been
secret, he would universally be regarded as the aggressor. England
was Frederick’s only ally—a treacherous ally, influenced
not by sympathy for Frederick, but by hatred of France, and by
fear of the loss of Hanover. The British cabinet would abandon
Prussia the first moment it should see it to be for its interest to
do so.</p>

<p>The King of Prussia had an army of two hundred thousand
men under perfect discipline. The Old Dessauer was dead, but
many veteran generals were in command. It was manifest that
war would soon burst forth. In addition to the personal pique
of the Duchess of Pompadour, who really ruled France, Louis
XV. was greatly exasperated by the secret alliance into which
Frederick had entered with England. The brother of the Prussian
king, Augustus William, the heir-apparent to the throne,
disapproved of this alliance. He said to the French minister,
Valori, “I would give a finger from my hand had it never been
concluded.”</p>

<p>In July, 1756, Frederick, for form’s sake, inquired, through his
embassador at Vienna, why Maria Theresa was making such formidable
military preparations. At the same time he conferred
with two of his leading generals, Schwerin and Retzow, if it
would not be better, since it was certain that Austria and Russia
would soon declare war, to anticipate them by an attack upon
Austria. The opinion of both, which was in perfect accord with
that of the king, was that it was best immediately to seize upon
Saxony, and in that rich and fertile country to gather magazines,
and make it the base for operations in Bohemia.</p>

<p>A spy was sent to Saxony, who reported that there were but
twenty thousand troops there. All necessary information was
promptly and secretly obtained in reference to roads and fortresses.
It required three weeks to receive an answer from Vienna.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
The reply was evasive, as Frederick knew that it would
be. In the mean time, his Prussian majesty, with characteristic
energy, had mustered on the frontier an army numbering in the
aggregate nearly one hundred and fifty thousand men. These
troops, in three divisions, with two thousand pieces of artillery,
were to make a rush upon Saxony. Among the directions given
by Frederick to the leaders of these divisions were the following:</p>

<p>“Each regiment shall take but one baggage-cart for a company.
No officer, whoever he may be or whatever his title, shall
take with him the least of silver plate, not even a silver spoon.
Whoever wants to keep table, great or small, must manage the
same with tin utensils, without exception, be he who he will.”</p>

<p>On the 25th of August, 1756, the king wrote from Potsdam to
his brother, the Prince of Prussia, and his sister Amelia, who
were at Berlin, as follows:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Brother, my dear Sister</span>,—I write you both at
once for want of time. I have as yet received no answer from
Vienna. I shall not get it till to-morrow. But I count myself
surer of war than ever, as the Austrians have named their generals,
and their army is ordered to march to Königgrätz. So
that, expecting nothing else but a haughty answer, or a very uncertain
one, on which there will be no reliance possible, I have
arranged every thing for setting out on Saturday next.”</p>

<p>Upon the ensuing day, having received the answer from Vienna,
he wrote to his brother:</p>

<p>“You have seen the paper I have sent to Vienna. Their answer
is, that they have not made an offensive alliance with Russia
against me. Of the assurance that I required there is not
one word, so that the sword alone can cut this Gordian knot. I
am innocent of this war. I have done what I could to avoid it;
but, whatever be one’s love of peace, one can not, and one must
not, sacrifice to that safety and honor. At present our one
thought must be to wage war in such a way as may cure our enemies
of their wish to break peace again too soon.”</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, August 28, 1756, the Prussian army,
over one hundred thousand strong, entered Saxony at three different
points on the northern frontier. Frederick, with about
sixty thousand troops, crossed the Elbe at Torgau, and seized
upon Leipsic. Duke Ferdinand, of Hanover, led his columns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
across the frontier about eighty miles to the right. The Duke of
Brunswick-Bevern crossed about the same distance to the left.
Each column was stronger than the whole Saxon army. The
appointed place of rendezvous for the three divisions was the
city of Dresden, the capital of Saxony. By the route marked
out, each column had a distance of about one hundred and fifty
miles to traverse.</p>

    <div class="caption">THE INVASION OF SAXONY.</div></div>

<p>“Thus,” writes Voltaire, “Frederick invaded Saxony under the
pretense of friendship, and that he might make war upon Maria
Theresa with the money of which he should rob the Saxons.”</p>

<p>Not a soldier appeared to oppose the invaders. The Prussians
seized, in an unobstructed march, all the most important Saxon
towns and fortresses. The King of Poland and his court, with
less than twenty thousand troops, had fled from the capital up
the river, which here runs from the south to Pirna, where they
concentrated their feeble army, which numbered but eighteen
thousand men. Frederick, with his resistless column, entered
Dresden on the 9th of September. The queen had remained in
the palace. The keys of the archives were demanded of her.
She refused to surrender them. The officers proceeded to break
open the door. The queen placed herself before the door. The
officers, shrinking from using personal violence, sent to Frederick
for instructions. He ordered them to force the archives, whatever
opposition the queen, in person, might present. The queen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
to avoid a rude assault, withdrew. The door was forced, and
the archives seized.</p>

<p>“The king found,” writes Voltaire, “<em>testimonies of the dread
which he had occasioned</em>. The queen died soon after of grief.
All Europe pitied that unfortunate family. But in the course
of those public calamities millions of families experienced hardships
not less great, though more obscure.”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>Thus was commenced the Seven Years’ War. It proved one
of the most bloody and cruel strifes which man has ever waged
against his brother man. Through its terrible scenes of conflagration,
blood, and despair, Frederick obtained the renown of being
one of the ablest generals who ever marshaled armies upon
fields of blood.</p>

<p>His Polish majesty had placed his feeble band of troops in the
vicinity of Pirna, on the Elbe, amidst the defiles of a mountainous
country, where they could easily defend themselves against
superior numbers. Winter was rapidly approaching. In those
high latitudes and among those bleak hills the storms of winter
ever raged with terrible severity. The Austrians were energetically
accumulating their forces in Bohemia to act against the
Prussians. The invasion of Saxony by Frederick, without any
apparent provocation, roused all Europe to intensity of hatred
and of action.</p>

<p>His Prussian majesty carefully examined the position of the
Saxons. They were in a region of precipices and chasms, broken
into a labyrinth of sky-piercing and craggy rocks. The eminences,
in some cases, rose two thousand feet, and were covered
with pine forests. “There is no stronger position in the world,”
Frederick writes. All these passes were fortified, mile after
mile, by batteries, ramparts, palisades, and abattis. But the
Saxon troops, taken unawares, had but a small supply of provisions.
Frederick decided to block every entrance to their encampment,
and thus to starve them out. His Polish majesty
sent frantic cries to France and Austria for help. Frederick
was assailed with the title of the “Prussian robber.”</p>

<p>The Dauphiness of France was daughter of the King of Poland.
With tears she craved protection for her parents. The
Duchess of Pompadour was anxious to show her gratitude to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
Maria Theresa, who had condescended to address her as a “cousin
and a dear sister.” A French army of one hundred thousand
men was soon on the march to aid Austria in the liberation of
Saxony. At the same time, an Austrian army of sixty thousand
men, under Marshal Browne, was advancing rapidly from Bohemia
to penetrate the fastnesses of the mountains for the release
of the Polish king.</p>

<p><i>a a. Prussian Infantry, b. Cavalry, c c.
Artillery. d d. Austrian Army.</i></p></div></div>

<p>On Friday, the 1st of October, 1756, the Prussian army under
Frederick, leaving the Saxons besieged in their encampment,
marched up the river to meet the foe advancing to the aid of
the Saxons. They encountered the Austrians, under Marshal
Browne, at Lobositz, about thirty miles south of Pirna. A terrible
battle of seven hours’ duration
ensued. The opposing generals were
of nearly equal ability. The soldiers
were equal in courage. The carnage
of the bloody conflict was almost
equal on either side. The desperation
of the Prussian assault was resistless.
Bayonet often crossed bayonet. The
Austrians were driven from their
strong position into the city. The
Prussians laid the city in ashes. As
the Austrians fled from the blazing streets, many, endeavoring to
swim across the Elbe, were drowned. At the close of this
bloody strife General Browne withdrew his army to the rear,
where he still presented a defiant front to the Prussians. He
had lost from his ranks, in killed and wounded, two thousand
nine hundred and eighty-four. The loss of Frederick was still
greater; it numbered three thousand three hundred and eight.
Neither party would confess to a defeat.</p>

<p>“Never have my troops,” writes Frederick, “done such miracles
of valor, cavalry as well as infantry, since I had the honor
to command them. By this dead-lift achievement I have seen
what they can do.”</p>

<p>The Prussians remained at Lobositz nearly a fortnight, to see
if Marshal Browne would again attempt to force the defiles.
The Saxon troops, for whose relief the Austrians were advancing,
were about thirty miles farther north, on the south, or left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
bank of the Elbe. The news of the repulse of Marshal Browne
at Lobositz fell disastrously upon their starving ranks. Maria
Theresa was much distressed. She sent a messenger to her Austrian
general to relieve the Saxons at whatever cost. A confidential
messenger was dispatched through the mountains to the
Saxon camp, which he reached in safety. He informed his Polish
majesty that Marshal Browne, with a picked force of eight
thousand, horse and foot, would march by a circuitous route of
sixty miles, so as to approach Pirna from the northeast, where
but a small Prussian force was stationed. He would be there
without fail on the 11th of August.</p>

<p>The Saxons were directed to cross the Elbe, by a sudden and
unexpected march at Königstein, a few miles from Pirna. Immediately
upon effecting the passage of the river they were to
fire two cannon as a signal that the feat was accomplished. The
Saxon and Austrian troops were then to form a junction, and co-operate
in crushing the few Prussian bands which were left there
as a guard. The Saxon troops would thus be rescued from the
trap in which they were inclosed, and from the famine which
was devouring them.</p>

<p>Marshal Browne skillfully and successfully performed his part
of the adventure. But there was no efficient co-operation by the
Saxons. The men were weak, emaciate, and perishing from hunger.
Their sinews of exertion were paralyzed. The skeleton
horses could not draw the wagons or the guns. To add to their
embarrassment, a raging storm of wind and rain burst upon the
camp. The roads were converted into quagmires. The night
was pitch-dark as the Saxons, about fourteen thousand in number,
drenched with rain and groping through the mud, abandoned
their camp and endeavored to steal their way across the river.
The watchful Prussians detected the movement. A scene of
confusion, terror, slaughter ensued, which it is in vain to endeavor
to describe. The weeping skies and moaning winds indicated
nature’s sympathy with these scenes of woe. Still the unhappy
Saxons struggled on heroically. After seventy hours of toilsome
marching and despairing conflict, these unhappy peasant-lads, the
victims of kingly pride, were compelled to surrender at discretion.
Marshal Browne, finding the enterprise an utter failure,
rapidly returned to the main body of his army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
Frederick was much embarrassed in deciding what to do with
his captives. They numbered about fourteen thousand. To
guard and feed them was too troublesome and expensive. They
could not be exchanged, as the King of Poland had no Prussian
prisoners. To set them at liberty would speedily place them in
the Austrian ranks to fight against him. Under these circumstances,
Frederick compelled them all to enlist as Prussian soldiers.
He <em>compelled</em> them to do this <em>voluntarily</em>, for they had
their choice either to enlist under his banners or to starve. The
King of Poland was permitted to return to Warsaw. The electorate
of Saxony, nearly as large as the State of Massachusetts,
and containing a population of one and a half millions, was annexed
to Prussia. The captured soldiers, prisoners of war, were
dressed in Prussian uniform, commanded by Prussian officers, and
either placed in garrison or in the ranks of the army in the field.
The public voice of Europe condemned Frederick very severely
for so unprecedented an act.</p>

<p>“Think of the sounds,” writes Carlyle, “uttered from human
windpipes, shrill with rage, some of them, hoarse others with
ditto; of the vituperations, execrations, printed and vocal—grating
harsh thunder upon Frederick and this new course of his.
Huge melody of discords, shrieking, groaning, grinding on that
topic through the afflicted universe in general.”</p>

<p>Voltaire embraced the opportunity of giving vent to his malice
in epigrams and lampoons. Frederick was by no means insensible
to public opinion, but he was ever willing to brave
that opinion if by so doing he could accomplish his ambitious
ends.</p>

<p>After this signal achievement his Prussian majesty established
his army in winter quarters along the banks of the Elbe.
He took up his abode in the palace of Dresden, awaiting the opening
of the spring campaign. Saxony was held with a tight
grasp, and taxes and recruits were gathered from the country as
if it had always belonged to Prussia. Frederick had hoped that
his sudden campaign would have led him into the heart of the
Austrian states. Instead of this, though he had wrested Saxony
from Poland, he had given Austria ample time to prepare her
armies for a long war, and had roused all Europe to intense hostility
against him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
It became more and more manifest to Frederick that he must
encounter a terrible conflict upon the opening of the spring.
Early in January he took a short trip to Berlin, but soon returned
to Dresden. Though he avoided all appearance of anxiety,
and kept up a cheerful air, he was fully conscious of his peril.
This is evident from the secret instructions he left with his minister,
Count Finck, upon his departure from Berlin. The dispatch
was dated January 10th, 1757:</p>

<p>“Should it chance that my army in Saxony were beaten, or
that the French should get possession of Hanover, and threaten
us with invasion from that quarter, or that the Russians should
get through by Neumark, you are to save the royal family and
the archives. Should we be beaten in Saxony, remove the royal
family to Cüstrin. Should the Russians enter by Neumark, or
a misfortune befall us in the Lausitz, all must go to Magdeburg,
but not till the last extremity. The garrison, the royal family,
and the treasure must be kept together. In such a case, the silver
plate and the gold plate must at once be coined into money.</p>

<p>“If I am killed, affairs must go on without alteration. If I
should be taken prisoner, I forbid you from paying the least regard
to my person, or paying the least heed to what I may write
from my place of detention. Should such misfortune happen to
me, I wish to sacrifice myself for the state. You must obey my
brother. He, as well as all my ministers and generals, shall answer
to me with their heads not to offer any province or ransom
for me, but to continue the war, pushing their advances as if I
had never existed in the world.”</p>

<p>Two days after committing this important document to Count
Finck, Frederick took leave of his mother and his brother. His
mother he never saw again. We have no evidence that on this
visit he even called upon his irreproachable, amiable, neglected
wife. In preparation for the worst, Frederick had provided poison
for himself, and wore it constantly about his person. It
consisted of several small pills in a glass tube. This fact is fully
established.</p>

<p>All Europe, England alone excepted, was aroused against him.
Armies were every where being marshaled. The press of all
continental Europe was filled with denunciations of his crimes
and encroachments. Not all his efforts to assume a careless air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
could efface from his countenance the impression left there by
the struggles of his soul. His features, as seen in a portrait
painted about this time, are expressive of the character of an
anxious and unhappy man.</p>

<p>Early in the spring of 1757, France, Russia, Austria, Poland,
and Sweden were combined against Frederick. These countries
represented a population of one hundred millions. Frederick’s
domains contained but five millions. His annual revenue was
but about ten million dollars. He had an army in the field of
one hundred and fifty thousand of the best troops in the world.
His fortresses were garrisoned by about fifty thousand of inferior
quality. The armies of the allies numbered four hundred and
thirty thousand. Frederick was regarded as an outlaw. The
design of the allies was to crush him, and to divide his territory
between them. Austria was to retake Silesia. France was to
have the Wesel-Cleve country. Russia was to annex to her domains
Prussen, Königsberg, etc. Poland, having regained Saxony,
was to add to her territory Magdeburg and Halle. Sweden
was to have Pomerania. Never before had there appeared such
a combination against any man. The situation of Frederick
seemed desperate.</p>

<p>France was first in the field with a superb host of one hundred
and ten thousand men. The other powers speedily followed.
In four great armies of invasion these hosts pressed upon
Prussia from the southeast and southwest, the northeast and
northwest. The Russian battalions were one hundred thousand
strong. The Austrian army was still more formidable.</p>

<p>It was supposed, that Frederick would remain in Saxony on
the defensive against the Austrians, who were rapidly gathering
their army at Prague, in Bohemia. The city was situated upon
the River Moldau, one of the tributaries of the Elbe, and was
about sixty miles south of Dresden.</p>

<p>On the 20th of April, Frederick, having secretly placed his
army in the best possible condition, commenced a rapid march
upon Prague, thus plunging into the very heart of Bohemia. He
advanced in three great columns up the valley of the Elbe and
the Moldau. His movements were so rapid and unexpected that
he seized several Austrian magazines which they had not even
time to burn. Three months’ provisions were thus obtained for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
his whole army. The first column, under the king, was sixty
thousand strong. The second column, led by General Bevern,
numbered twenty-three thousand, horse and foot. The third,
under Marshal Schwerin, counted thirty-two thousand foot and
twelve thousand horse. On the 2d of May the banners of Frederick
were seen from the steeples of Prague. They appeared
floating from the heights of the Weissenberg, a few miles west of
the city. At the same time, the other two columns, which had
united under Marshal Schwerin, appeared on the east side of the
Moldau, upon both banks of which the city is built.</p>

<p>On the 5th of May, after careful reconnoissance, Frederick
crossed the Moldau several miles north of Prague. He went
over upon pontoons unopposed, and thus effected a junction with
his troops on the east side of the river. The Austrian army was
drawn up on some formidable heights but a short distance east
of the city. Their position was very strong, and they were thoroughly
intrenched. On the 6th of May the dreadful battle of
Prague was fought. For many years, as not a few of our readers
will remember, it was fought over and over again upon all the
pianos in Christendom. They will remember the awe with which,
as children, they listened to the tumult of the battle, swelling
forth from the ivory keys, with the rattle of musketry, the booming
of the cannon, and the groans of the dying—such groans as
even the field of battle itself could scarcely have rivaled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
The final and decisive struggle took place on and around two
important eminences, called the Sterbohol Hill and the Homoly
Hill. Both of these heights the Prussians stormed. In the following
glowing words Carlyle pictures the scene:</p>

<p>“Fearful tugging, swagging, and swaying is conceivable in
this Sterbohol problem! And, after long scanning, I rather
judge that it was in the wake of that first repulse that the veteran
Schwerin himself got his death. No one times it for us;
but the fact is unforgetable; and in the dim whirl of sequences
dimly places itself there. Very certain it is ‘at sight of his own
regiment in retreat,’ Field-marshal Schwerin seized the colors, as
did other generals, who are not named, that day. Seizes the
colors, fiery old man: ‘This way, my sons!’ and rides ahead along
the straight dam again; his ‘sons’ all turning, and with hot repentance
following. ‘On, my children, this way!’ Five bits of
grape-shot, deadly each of them, at once hit the old man; dead
he sinks there on his flag; and will never fight more.</p>

<p>“‘This way!’ storm the others with hot tears; Adjutant Von
Platen takes the flag: Platen too is instantly shot; but another
takes it. ‘This way, on!’ in wild storm of rage and grief; in a
word, they managed to do the work at Sterbohol, they and the
rest. First line, second line, infantry, cavalry (and even the very
horses, I suppose), fighting inexpressibly; conquering one of the
worst problems ever seen in war. For the Austrians too, especially
their grenadiers there, stood to it toughly, and fought like
men; and ‘every grenadier that survived of them,’ as I read afterward,
‘got double pay for life.’</p>

<p>“Done, that Sterbohol work; those foot-chargings, horse-chargings;
that battery of Homoly Hill; and, hanging upon that, all
manner of redoubts and batteries to the rightward and rearward;
but how it was done no pen can describe, nor any intellect in
clear sequence understand. An enormous <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mêlée</i> there: new Prussian
battalions charging, and ever new, irrepressible by case-shot,
as they successively get up; Marshal Browne, too, sending for
new battalions at double-quick from his left, disputing stiffly
every inch of his ground, till at length (hour not given), a cannon
shot tore away his foot, and he had to be carried into
Prague, mortally wounded. Which probably was a most important
circumstance, or the most important of all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
“This battle,” writes Frederick, “which began toward nine in
the morning, was one of the bloodiest of the age. The enemy
lost twenty-four thousand men, of whom four thousand were
prisoners. The Prussian loss amounted to eighteen thousand
fighting men, without counting Marshal Schwerin, who was alone
worth above ten thousand. This day saw the pillars of the
Prussian infantry cut down.”</p>

<p>Immediately after the battle, Frederick wrote rather a stately
letter to his mother, informing her of his victory, and that he was
about to pursue the foe with a hundred and fifty thousand men.
Fifty thousand of the defeated Austrians entered Prague, and
stood at bay behind its ramparts. Frederick seized all the avenues,
that no provisions could enter the city, convinced that
starvation, combined with a vigorous assault, would soon compel
the garrison to surrender themselves, the city, and all its magazines.
On the 9th of May the bombardment with red-hot balls
commenced. The siege lasted six weeks, creating an amount of
misery over which angels might weep. The balls of fire were
constantly kindling wide and wasting conflagrations. Soon a
large portion of the city presented only a heap of smouldering
ruins.</p>

<p>Besides the garrison of fifty thousand there were eighty thousand
inhabitants in the city, men, women, and children. Large
numbers perished. Some died of starvation; some were burned
to death in their blazing dwellings; some were torn to pieces by
shot and shell; some were buried beneath the ruins of their
houses. In the stillness of the night the wails and groans of the
sufferers were borne on the breeze to the ears of the Prussians
in their intrenched camp. Starvation brought pestilence, which
caused the death of thousands. The inhabitants, reduced to this
state of awful misery, entreated the Austrian general to surrender.
He refused, but forced out of the gates twelve thousand
skeleton, starving people, who consumed the provisions, but could
not contribute to the defense. Frederick drove the poor creatures
back again at the point of the bayonet, threatening to shoot
them all. The cruel act was deemed a necessity of war.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa, anxious to save Prague, sent an army of sixty
thousand men under General Daun to its relief. This army, on
the rapid march, had reached Kolin, about fifty miles east of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
Prague. Should General Daun, as was his plan, attack Frederick
in the rear, while the fifty thousand in Prague should sally
out and attack him in front, ruin would be almost inevitable.
Frederick, gathering thirty-four thousand men, marched rapidly
to Kolin and attacked the foe with the utmost possible fierceness.
The Austrians not only nearly twice outnumbered him,
but were also in a very commanding position, protected by earthworks.
Never did men fight more reckless of life than did the
Prussians upon this occasion.</p>

<p>“And so from right wing to left,” writes Carlyle, “miles long
there is now universal storm of volleying, bayonet charging,
thunder of artillery, case-shot, cartridge-shot, and sulphurous devouring
whirlwind; the wrestle very tough and furious, especially
on the assaulting side. Here, as at Prague, the Prussian
troops were one and all in the fire, each doing strenuously his
utmost. There is no reserve left. All is gone up into one combustion.
To fan the fire, to be here, there, fanning the fire where
need shows, this is now Frederick’s function. This death-wrestle
lasted, perhaps, four hours; till seven, or perhaps eight o’clock,
of a June evening.”</p>

<p>Frederick exposed himself like a common soldier. Indeed, it
sometimes seems that, in the desperate state of his affairs, he
sought the fatal bullet. All his efforts against the Austrians
were in vain. The Prussians were repulsed with dreadful
slaughter. After losing fourteen thousand men in killed, wounded,
and prisoners, forty-five cannon, and twenty-two flags, Frederick
was compelled to order a retreat. His magnificent regiment
of guards, one thousand in number, picked men, undoubtedly the
best body of troops in the world, was almost annihilated. The
loss of the Austrians was about nine thousand men. They were
so accustomed to be defeated by Frederick that they were equally
surprised and delighted by this dearly-earned victory. The
following plan will give the military reader an idea of the position
of the hostile forces.</p>

<p>Still the conquerors had such dread of their foe that they
dared not emerge from their ramparts to pursue him. Had they
done so, they might easily have captured or slain his whole army.
Frederick bore adversity with great apparent equanimity. He
did not for a moment lose self-control, or manifest any agitation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
With great skill he conducted his retreat. Immediately after
the battle he wrote to his friend Lord Marischall:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Prosperity, my dear lord, often inspires a dangerous confidence.
Twenty-three battalions were not sufficient to drive
sixty thousand men from their intrenchments. Another time
we will take our precautions better. Fortune has this day turned
her back upon me. I ought to have expected it. She is a
female, and I am not gallant. What say you to this league
against the Margrave of Brandenburg? How great would be
the astonishment of the great elector if he could see his great-grandson
at war at the same time with the Russians, the Austrians,
almost all Germany, and one hundred thousand French
auxiliaries! I do not know whether it will be disgraceful in
me to be overcome, but I am sure there will be no great glory in
vanquishing me.”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Frederick retreated down the banks of the Elbe, and sent
couriers to the camp at Prague, ordering the siege immediately
to be raised, and the troops to retire down the Moldau to join
him at Leitmeritz. The news was received at the camp at two
o’clock on Sunday morning, June 19, creating amazement and
consternation. As Frederick was on his retreat with his broken
battalions from the field of battle, parched with thirst, burning
with heat, and smothered with dust, it is recorded that an old
dragoon brought to the king, in his steel cap, some water which
he had drawn from a well, saying to his sovereign, consolingly,</p>

<p>“Never mind, sire, God Almighty and we will mend this yet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
The enemy may get a victory for once, but that does not send
us to the devil.”</p>

<p>At Nimburg, about twenty miles from Kolin, where the retiring
Prussians were crossing the Elbe, Frederick sat upon a green
mound, lost in thought, as his troops defiled before him. He
was scratching figures upon the sand with his stick.</p>

    <div class="caption">AFTER THE DEFEAT.</div></div>

<p>“Raising his eyes,” says Archenholtz, “he surveyed, with
speechless emotion, the small remnant of his life-guard of foot,
his favorite battalion. It was one thousand strong yesterday
morning, hardly four hundred now. All the soldiers of this
chosen battalion were personally known to him—their names,
their age, their native place, their history. In one day death
had mowed them down. They had fought like heroes, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
was for him they had died. His eyes were visibly wet. Down
his face rolled silent tears.”</p>

<p>Suddenly dashing the tears away, he issued his swift orders,
and, mounting his horse, galloped to Prague, where he arrived
Sunday evening. The next day the siege was raised, and the
besieging troops were on the retreat north into Saxony. The
whole army was soon rendezvoused at Leitmeritz, on the Elbe,
about thirty miles south of Dresden. Here Frederick awaited
the development of the next movement of his foes.</p>

<p>He had hardly arrived at Leitmeritz ere he received the tidings
of the death of Sophia Dorothea, his mother. She died at
Berlin on the 28th of June, 1757, in the seventy-first year of her
age. This grief, coming in the train of disasters which seemed
to be overwhelming his Prussian majesty, affected him very deeply.
Frederick was subdued and softened by sorrow. He remembered
the time when a mother’s love rocked his cradle, and
wrapped him around with tender care. The reader will be surprised
to learn that his grief—perhaps with some comminglings
of remorse—was so great that he shut himself in his closet, and
wept with sobbings like a child.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">The</span> tidings of the death of the king’s mother reached him on
the 2d of July, 1757. Sir Andrew Mitchell, the English embassador
in Berlin, gives the following account of an interview he
had with Frederick on that occasion:</p>

<p>“Yesterday, July 3d, the king sent for me, in the afternoon,
the first time he has seen any body since the news came. I had
the honor to remain with him in his closet. I must own I was
most sensibly affected to see him indulging his grief, and giving
way to the warmest filial affections; recalling to mind the many
obligations he had to her late majesty; all she had suffered, and
how nobly she had borne it; the good she did to every body;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
the one comfort he now had, that he tried to make her last years
more agreeable.”</p>

    <div class="caption">SOPHIA DOROTHEA.</div></div>

<p>On the 1st of July, the day before the king heard of his mother’s
death, he wrote to Wilhelmina, in reply to a letter from her
which expressed great anxiety on his account:</p>

<p>“Dear sister, fear nothing on my score. Men are always in
the hand of what we call destiny. Accidents will befall people
walking on the streets, sitting in their room, lying on their bed;
and there are many who escape the perils of war.”</p>

<p>Again, on the 5th of July, he wrote: “I write to apprise you,
my dear sister, of the new grief that overwhelms us. We have
no longer a mother. This loss puts the crown on my sorrows.
I am obliged to act, and have not time to give free course to my
tears. Judge, I pray you, of the situation of a feeling heart put
to so severe a trial. All losses in the world are capable of being
remedied, but those which death causes are beyond the reach of
hope.”</p>

<p>On the 7th of July he wrote again to Wilhelmina. The letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
reveals the anxiety of his heart, and his earnest desire to escape,
if possible, from his embarrassments. Wilhelmina had written,
offering her services to endeavor to secure peace. The king
replied:</p>

<p>“You are too good. I am ashamed to abuse your indulgence.
But do, since you are willing, try and sound the French, and learn
what conditions of peace they would demand. Send that Mirabeau<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
to France. Willingly will I pay the expense. He may
offer as much as five million thalers [$3,750,000] to the Favorite<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>
for peace alone.”</p>

<p>Soon after this, Frederick again wrote to his sister a letter
which throws so much light upon his character that we give it
almost entire:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
“Leitmeritz, July 13, 1757.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sister</span>,—Your letter has arrived. I see in it your
regrets for the irreparable loss we have had of the best and
worthiest mother in this world. I am so overwhelmed by these
blows from within and without that I feel myself in a sort of
stupefaction.</p>

<p>“The French have seized upon Friesland, and are about to
pass the Weser. They have instigated the Swedes to declare
war against me. The Swedes are sending seventeen thousand
men into Pomerania. The Russians are besieging Memel. General
Schwald has them on his front and in his rear. The troops
of the empire are also about to march. All this will force me to
evacuate Bohemia so soon as that crowd of enemies gets into
motion.</p>

<p>“I am firmly resolved on the utmost efforts to save my country.
Happy the moment when I took to training myself in philosophy.
There is nothing else that can sustain a soul in a situation
like mine. I spread out to you, my dear sister, the detail
of my sorrows. If these things regarded myself only, I could
stand it with composure. But I am the bound guardian of the
happiness of a people which has been put under my charge.
There lies the sting of it. And I shall have to reproach myself
with every fault if, by delay or by overhaste, I occasion the
smallest accident.</p>

<p>“I am in the condition of a traveler who sees himself surrounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
and ready to be assassinated by a troop of cut-throats, who
intend to share his spoils. Since the league of Cambrai<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> there
is no example of such a conspiracy as that infamous triumvirate,
Austria, France, Russia, now forms against me. Was it ever before
seen that three great princes laid plot in concert to destroy
a fourth who had done nothing against them? I have not had
the least quarrel either with France or with Russia, still less
with Sweden.</p>

<p>“Happy, my dear sister, is the obscure man whose good sense,
from youth upward, has renounced all sorts of glory; who, in his
safe and humble place, has none to envy him, and whose fortune
does not excite the cupidity of scoundrels. But these reflections
are vain. We have to be what our birth, which decides, has
made us in entering upon this world.</p>

<p>“I beg a thousand pardons, my dear sister. In these three
long pages I talk to you of nothing but my troubles and affairs.
A strange abuse it would be of any other person’s friendship.
But yours, my dear sister, is known to me; and I am persuaded
that you are not impatient when I open to you my heart—a
heart which is yours altogether, being filled with sentiments of
the tenderest esteem, with which I am, my dearest sister, your</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">Frederick</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>At this time the whole disposable force of his Prussian majesty
did not exceed eighty thousand men. There were marching
against him combined armies of not less, in the aggregate,
than four hundred thousand. A part of the Prussian army,
about thirty thousand strong, under the king’s eldest brother,
Augustus William, Prince of Prussia, was sent north, especially
to protect Zittau, a very fine town of about ten thousand inhabitants,
where Frederick had gathered his chief magazines.
Prince Charles, with seventy thousand Austrians, pursued this
division. He outgeneraled the Prince of Prussia, drove him into
wild country roads, took many prisoners, captured important
fortresses, and, opening a fire of red-hot shot upon Zittau, laid
the whole place, with its magazines, in ashes. The Prince of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
Prussia, who witnessed the conflagration which he could not prevent,
retreated precipitately toward Lobau, and thence to Bautzen,
with his army in a deplorable condition of exhaustion and
destitution.</p>

<p>Here Frederick, with the remainder of the army from Leitmeritz,
joined his brother, against whom he was greatly incensed,
attributing the disasters he had encountered to his incapacity.
At four o’clock of the 30th of July the king met the Prince of
Prussia and the other generals of the discomfited army. Both
parties approached the designated spot on horseback. The king,
who was accompanied by his suite, upon his arrival within about
two hundred feet of the place where his brother, with his officers,
was awaiting him, without saluting the prince or recognizing
him in the slightest degree, dismounted, and threw himself in a
reclining posture upon the greensward. General Goltz was then
sent with the following message to the prince:</p>

<p>“His majesty commands me to inform your royal highness that
he has cause to be greatly discontented with you; that you deserve
to have a court-martial held over you, which would sentence
you and all your generals to death; but that his majesty
will not carry the matter so far, being unable to forget that in
the chief general he has a brother.”</p>

<p>Augustus William, overwhelmed by his disgrace, and yet angered
by the rebuke, coldly replied that he desired only that a
court-martial should investigate the case and pronounce judgment.
The king forbade that any intercourse whatever should
take place between his own troops, soldiers, or officers, and those
of his brother, who, he declared, had utterly degraded themselves
by the loss of all courage and ambition. The prince sent to the
king General Schultz to obtain the countersign for the army.
Frederick refused to receive him, saying “that he had no countersign
to send to cowards.” Augustus William then went himself
to present his official report and a list of his troops. Frederick
took the papers without saying a word, and then turned
his back upon his brother. This cruel treatment fell with crushing
force upon the unhappy prince. Conscious of military failure,
disgraced in the eyes of his generals and soldiers, and abandoned
by the king, his health and spirits alike failed him. The
next morning he wrote a sad, respectfully reproachful letter to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
Frederick, stating that his health rendered it necessary for him
to retire for a season from the army to recruit. The reply of the
king, which was dated Bautzen, July 30, 1757, shows how desperate
he, at that time, considered the state of his affairs. Hopeless
of victory, he seems to have sought only death.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,—Your bad conduct has greatly injured
my affairs. It is not the enemy, but your ill-concerted measures,
which have done me this harm. My generals also are inexcusable,
whether they gave you bad advice or only suffered you to
come to such injudicious resolutions. In this sad situation it
only remains for me to make a last attempt. I must hazard a
battle. If we can not conquer, we must all of us have ourselves
killed.</p>

<p>“I do not complain of your heart, but of your incapacity, and
of the little judgment you have shown in making your decisions.
A man who has but a few days to live need not dissemble. I
wish you better fortune than mine has been, and that all the
miseries and bad adventures you have had may teach you to
treat important matters with greater care, sense, and resolution
than you have hitherto done. The greatest part of the calamities
which I now apprehend comes only from you. You and
your children will suffer more from them than I shall. Be persuaded,
nevertheless, that I have always loved you, and that with
these sentiments I shall die.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Frederick.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon the reception of this letter, the prince, without replying
to it, verbally asked leave, through one of his officers, to throw
up his commission and retire to his family in Berlin. The king
scornfully replied, “Let him go; he is fit for nothing else.” In
the deepest dejection the prince returned to his home. Rapidly
his health failed, and before the year had passed away, as we
shall have occasion hereafter to mention, he sank into the grave,
deploring his unhappy lot.</p>

<p>Frederick speedily concentrated all his strength at Bautzen,
and strove to draw the Austrians into a battle; but in vain.
The heights upon which they were intrenched, bristling with
cannon, he could not venture to assail. After three weeks of
impatient manœuvring, Frederick gathered his force of fifty thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
men close in hand, and made a sudden rush upon Bernstadt,
about fifty miles to the east of Bautzen. Here he surprised an
Austrian division, scattered it to the winds, seized all its baggage,
and took a number of prisoners. He also captured the
field equipage, coach, horses, etc., of General Nadasti, who narrowly
escaped.</p>

<p>The French, advancing from the Rhine on the west, were
sweeping all opposition before them. They had overrun Hanover,
and compelled the Duke of Brunswick, brother of George II.,
to withdraw, with his Hanoverian troops, from the alliance with
the King of Prussia. This was a terrible blow to Frederick.
It left him entirely alone to encounter his swarming enemies.</p>

<p>The Prince of Soubise had rendezvoused fifty thousand French
and Saxon troops at Erfurt, about a hundred and seventy miles
west of Dresden. He had also, scattered around at different
posts, easily accessible, a hundred thousand more well-armed and
well-disciplined troops. Frederick took twenty-three thousand
men and marched to assail these foes in almost despairing battle.
To plunge with so feeble a band into such a mass of enemies
seemed to be the extreme of recklessness.</p>

<p>On the 30th of August Frederick commenced his march from
Dresden. Great caution was requisite, and great military skill,
in so bold an adventure. On the 13th of September he reached
Erfurt. The Prince of Soubise, aware of the prowess of his antagonist,
retired to the hills and intrenched himself, waiting until
he could accumulate forces which would render victory certain.
Frederick had now with him his second brother, Henry,
who seems to have very fully secured his confidence. On the
16th of September the king wrote:</p>

<p>“My brother Henry has gone to see the Duchess of Gotha to-day.
I am so oppressed with grief that I would rather keep my
sadness to myself. I have reason to congratulate myself much
on account of my brother Henry. He has behaved like an angel,
as a soldier, and well toward me as a brother. I can not,
unfortunately, say the same of the elder. He sulks at me, and
has sulkily retired to Torgau, from which place he has gone to
Wittenberg. I shall leave him to his caprices and to his bad
conduct; and I prophesy nothing for the future unless the
younger guide him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
In these hours of trouble the noble Wilhelmina was as true
to her brother as the magnet to the pole. She was appalled by
no dangers, and roused all her energies to aid that brother, struggling,
with the world arrayed against him. The king appreciated
his sister’s love. In a poetic epistle addressed to her, composed
in these hours of adversity, he wrote:</p>

<p>“Oh sweet and dear hope of my remaining days! oh sister
whose friendship, so fertile in resources, shares all my sorrows,
and with a helpful arm assists me in the gulf! it is in vain
that the destinies have overwhelmed me with disasters. If the
crowd of kings have sworn my ruin, if the earth have opened to
swallow me, you still love me, noble and affectionate sister.
Loved by you, what is there of misfortune?”</p>

<p>In conclusion, he gives utterance to that gloomy creed of infidelity
and atheism which he had adopted instead of the Christian
faith. “Thus destiny with a deluge of torments fills the
poisoned remnants of my days. The present is hideous to me,
the future unknown. Do you say that I am the creature of a
beneficent being? I see that all men are the sport of destiny.
And if there do exist some gloomy and inexorable being who
allows a despised herd of creatures to go on multiplying here,
he values them as nothing. He looks down on our virtues, our
misdeeds, on the horrors of war, and on all the cruel plagues
which ravage earth, as a thing indifferent to him. Wherefore my
sole refuge and only haven, loved sister, is in the arms of death.”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<p>Twenty years before this, Frederick, in a letter to his friend
Baron Suhm, dated June 6, 1736, had expressed the belief that,
while the majority of the world perished at death, a few very
distinguished men might be immortal.</p>

<p>“The thought alone,” he wrote, “of your death, my dear Suhm,
affords me an argument in proof of the immortality of the soul.
For is it possible that the spirit which acts in you with so much
clearness, brightness, and intelligence, which is so different from
matter and from body—that fine soul endowed with so many
solid virtues and agreeable qualities—is it possible that this
should not be immortal? No! I would maintain in solid argument
that, if the greatest part of the world were to be annihilated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
you, Voltaire, Boileau, Newton, Wolfius, and some other
geniuses of this order must be immortal.”<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>Now, however, Frederick, in that downward path through
which the rejecters of Christianity invariably descend, had reached
the point at which he renounced all belief in the immortality
of the soul and in the existence of God. In a poetic epistle addressed
to Marshal Keith, he declares himself a materialist, and
affirms his unwavering conviction that the soul, which he says
is but the result of the bodily organization, perishes with that
body. He declares suicide to be the only remedy for man in his
hour of extremity.</p>

<p>Wilhelmina, in her distress in view of the peril of her brother,
wrote to Voltaire, hoping that he might be persuaded to exert
an influence in his favor.</p>

<p>“The king, my brother,” she wrote, “supports his misfortunes
with a courage and a firmness worthy of him. I am in a frightful
state, and will not survive the destruction of my house and
family. That is the one consolation that remains to me. I can
not write farther of it. My soul is so troubled that I know not
what I am doing. To me there remains nothing but to follow
his destiny if it is unfortunate. I have never piqued myself on
being a philosopher, though I have made many efforts to become
so. The small progress I made did teach me to despise grandeur
and riches. <em>But I could never find in philosophy any cure for
the wounds of the heart, except that of getting done with our miseries
by ceasing to live.</em> The state I am in is worse than death.
I see the greatest man of his age, my brother, my friend, reduced
to the most frightful extremity. I see my whole family exposed
to dangers and, perhaps, destruction. Would to Heaven I were
alone loaded with all the miseries I have described to you.”</p>

<p>Five days after this letter was written to Voltaire by Wilhelmina
from Baireuth, Frederick, on the 17th of September, 1757,
wrote his sister from near Erfurt. This letter, somewhat abbreviated,
was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">“My dearest Sister</span>,—I find no other consolation but in your
precious letters. May Heaven<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> reward so much virtue and such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
heroic sentiments! Since I wrote you last my misfortunes have
but gone on accumulating. It seems as though destiny would
discharge all its wrath and fury upon the poor country which I
had to rule over. I have advanced this way to fall upon a corps
of the allied army, which has run off and intrenched itself among
hills, whither to follow, still more to attack them, all rules of war
forbid. The moment I retire toward Saxony this whole swarm
will be upon my heels. Happen what may, I am determined,
at all risks, to fall upon whatever corps of the enemy approaches
me nearest. I shall even bless Heaven for its mercy if it grant
me the favor to die sword in hand.</p>

<p>“Should this hope fail me, you will allow that it would be
too hard to crawl at the feet of a company of traitors to whom
successful crimes have given the advantage to prescribe the law
to me. If I had followed my own inclinations I should have
put an end to myself at once after that unfortunate battle which
I lost. But I felt that this would be weakness, and that it behooved
me to repair the evil which had happened. But no
sooner had I hastened this way to face new enemies than Winterfield
was beaten and killed near Gorlitz; than the French entered
the heart of my states; than the Swedes blockaded Stettin.
Now there is nothing effective left for me to do. There
are too many enemies. Were I even to succeed in beating two
armies, the third would crush me. As for you, my incomparable
sister, I have not the heart to turn you from your resolves. We
think alike, and I can not condemn in you the sentiments which
I daily entertain. Life has been given us as a benefit. When
it ceases to be such— I have nobody left in this world to attach
me to it but you. My friends, the relations I loved most,
are in the grave. In short, I have lost every thing. If you take
the resolution which I have taken, we end together our misfortunes
and our unhappiness.</p>

<p>“But it is time to end this long, dreary letter. I have had
some leisure, and have used it to open to you a heart filled with
admiration and gratitude toward you. Yes, my adorable sister,
if Providence troubled itself about human affairs, you ought to
be the happiest person in the universe. Your not being such
confirms me in the sentiments expressed in my epistle.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In his “epistle” Frederick had expressed the opinion that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
there was no God who took any interest in human affairs. He
had also repeatedly expressed the resolve to Wilhelmina, and to
Voltaire, to whom he had become partially reconciled, that he
was prepared to commit suicide should events prove as disastrous
as he had every reason to expect they would prove. He
had also urged his sister to follow his example, and not to survive
the ruin of the family. Such was the support which the
king, in hours of adversity, found in that philosophy for which
he had discarded the religion of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>On the 15th of September, two days before Frederick had
written the despairing letter we have just given, Wilhelmina
wrote again to him, in response to previous letters, and to his
poetic epistle.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest Brother</span>,—Your letter and the one you wrote
to Voltaire have nearly killed me. What fatal resolutions, great
God! Ah! my dear brother, you say you love me, and you drive
a dagger into my heart. Your epistle, which I did receive, made
me shed rivers of tears. I am now ashamed of such weakness.
My misfortune would be so great that I should find worthier resources
than tears. Your lot shall be mine. I shall not survive
your misfortunes, or those of the house I belong to. You may
calculate that such is my firm resolution.</p>

<p>“But, after this avowal, allow me to entreat you to look back
at what was the pitiable state of your enemy when you lay before
Prague. It is the sudden whirl of fortune for both parties.
The like can occur again when one is the least expecting it.
Cæsar was the slave of pirates, and yet he became master of the
world. A great genius like yours finds resources even when all
is lost.</p>

<p>“I suffer a thousand times more than I can tell you. Nevertheless,
hope does not abandon me. I am obliged to finish.
But I shall never cease to be, with the most profound respect,
your</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Wilhelmina</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 11th of October an express courier reached Frederick’s
camp with the alarming intelligence that an Austrian division
of fifteen thousand men was on the march for Berlin. The city
was but poorly fortified, and held a garrison of but four thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
troops. Frederick had no doubt that the Austrian army
was acting in co-operation with other forces of the allies, advancing
upon his metropolis from the east, north, and west. Immediately
he collected all his available troops and commenced a
rapid march for the protection of his capital. In the mean time
Wilhelmina had heard of this new peril. A rumor also had
reached her that there had been a battle, and that her brother
was wounded. The following letter reveals the anguish of her
heart:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
“Baireuth, October 15, 1757.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest Brother</span>,—Death and a thousand torments
could not equal the frightful state I am in. There run reports
that make me shudder. Some say that you are wounded, others
that you are dangerously ill. In vain have I tormented myself
to have news of you. I can get none. Oh, my dear brother,
come what may, I will not survive you. If I am to continue in
this frightful uncertainty, I can not stand it. In the name of
God, bid some one write to me.</p>

<p>“I know not what I have written. My heart is torn in pieces.
I feel that by dint of disquietude and alarms I am losing my
senses. Oh, my dear, adorable brother, have pity on me. The
least thing that concerns you pierces me to the heart. Might I
die a thousand deaths provided you lived and were happy! I
can say no more. Grief chokes me. I can only repeat that
your fate shall be mine; being, my dear brother, your</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">Wilhelmina</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>It turned out that the rumor of the march upon Berlin was
greatly exaggerated. General Haddick, with an Austrian force
of but four thousand men, by a sudden rush through the woods,
seized the suburbs of Berlin. The terrified garrison, supposing
that an overwhelming force of the allied army was upon them,
retreated, with the royal family and effects, to Spandau. General
Haddick, having extorted a ransom of about one hundred
and forty thousand dollars from the city, and “<em>two dozen pair of
gloves</em> for the empress queen,” and learning that a division of
Frederick’s army was fast approaching, fled precipitately. Hearing
of this result, the king arrested his steps at Torgau, and returned
to Leipsic. The Berliners asserted that “the two dozen
pair of gloves were all gloves for the left hand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
Frederick reached Leipsic on the 26th of October. The allied
forces were rapidly concentrating in overwhelming numbers
around him. On the 30th the king marched to the vicinity of
Lutzen, where he encamped for the night. General Soubise,
though in command of a force outnumbering that of the Prussians
nearly three to one, retreated rapidly to the west before
Frederick, and crossed the River Saale. Frederick followed, and
effected the passage of the stream with but little opposition.</p>

    <div class="caption">MAP OF THE CAMPAIGN OF ROSSBACH.</div></div>

<p>After some manœuvring, the hostile forces met upon a wide,
dreary, undulating plain, with here and there a hillock, in the
vicinity of Rossbach. Frederick had twenty thousand men. The
French general, Prince Soubise, had sixty thousand. The allies
now felt sure of their prey. Their plan was to surround Frederick,
destroy his army, and take him a prisoner. On the morning
of the 5th of November the two hostile armies were nearly
facing each other, a few miles west of the River Saale. A party
of Austrians was sent by the general of the allies to destroy the
bridges upon the river in the rear of the Prussians, that their
retreat might be cut off. Frederick, from a house-top, eagerly
watched the movement of his foes. To his surprise and great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
satisfaction, he soon saw the whole allied army commencing a
circuitous march around his left to fall upon him in his rear.</p>

<p>Instantly, and “like a change of scene in the opera,” the Prussians
were on the rapid march to the east in as perfect order as
if on parade. Taking advantage of an eminence called James
Hill, which concealed their movements from the allies, Frederick
hurled his whole concentrated force upon the flank of the van of
the army on the advance. He thus greatly outnumbered his
foes at the point of attack. The enemy, taken by surprise in
their long line of march, had no time to form.</p>

<p>“Compact as a wall, and with an incredible velocity, Seidlitz,
in the blaze of rapid steel, is in upon them.” From the first it
was manifest that the destruction of the advance-guard was certain.
The Prussian cavalry slashed through it again and again,
throwing it into inextricable disorder. In less than half an hour
this important portion of the allied troops was put to utter rout,
“tumbling off the ground, plunging down hill in full flight, across
its own infantry, or whatever obstacle, Seidlitz on the hips of it,
and galloping madly over the horizon.”</p>

<p>And now the Prussian artillery, eighteen heavy guns, opened
a rapid and murderous fire upon the disordered mass, struggling
in vain to deploy in line of battle. Infantry, artillery, cavalry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
all were at work, straining every nerve, one mighty mind controlling
and guiding the terrible mechanism in its death-dealing
blows. The French regiments were jammed together. The Prussians,
at forty paces, opened a platoon fire of musketry, five shots
a minute. At the same moment the impetuous Seidlitz, with his
triumphant and resistless dragoons, plunged upon the rear. The
centre of the allied army was thus annihilated. It was no longer
a battle, but a rout and a massacre. In twenty minutes this second
astonishing feat was accomplished.</p>

<p>The whole allied army was now put wildly to flight, in one
of the most humiliating and disastrous retreats which has ever
occurred. There is generally some slight diversity of statement
in reference to the numbers engaged on such occasions. Frederick
gives sixty-three thousand as the allied force. The allies
lost, in killed, wounded, and missing, about ten thousand men.
The loss of the Prussians was but five hundred. The French, in
a tumultuous mass, fled to the west. Crossing the Unstrut River
at Freiburg, they burned the bridge behind them. The Prussians
rebuilt the bridge, and vigorously pursued. The evening
after the battle the king wrote as follows to Wilhelmina. His
letter was dated “Near Weissenfels.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“At last, my dear sister, I can announce to you a bit of good
news. You were doubtless aware that the Coopers with their
circles had a mind to take Leipsic. I ran up and drove them
beyond Saale. They called themselves 63,000 strong. Yesterday
I went to reconnoitre them; could not attack them in the
post they held. This rendered them rash. To-day they came
out to attack me. It was a battle after one’s own heart. Thanks
to God,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> I have not one hundred men killed. My brother Henry
and General Seidlitz have slight hurts. We have all the enemy’s
cannon. I am in full march to drive them over the Unstrut.
You, my dear sister, my good, my divine, my affectionate
sister, who deign to interest yourself in the fate of a brother who
adores you, deign also to share my joy. The instant I have time
I will tell you more. I embrace you with my whole heart.
Adieu.</p>

<p class="sigright">
F.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Voltaire, speaking of this conflict, says, “It was the most inconceivable
and complete rout and discomfiture of which history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
makes any mention. Thirty thousand French and twenty thousand
imperial troops were there seen making a disgraceful and
precipitate flight before five battalions and a few squadrons.
The defeats of Agincourt, Cressy, and Poitiers were not so humiliating.”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>As usual, Frederick wrote a poem upon the occasion. It was
vulgar and profane. Carlyle says of it, “The author, with a wild
burst of spiritual enthusiasm, sings the charms of the rearward
part of certain men. He rises to the height of anti-biblical profanity,
quoting Moses on the Hill of Vision; sinks to the bottomless
of human or ultra-human depravity, quoting King Nicomedes’s
experience on Cæsar, happily known only to the learned.
A most cynical, profane affair; yet we must say, by way of parenthesis,
one which gives no countenance to Voltaire’s atrocities
of rumor about Frederick himself in the matter.”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>The routed allies, exasperated and starving, and hating the
Protestant inhabitants of the region through which they retreated,
robbed and maltreated them without mercy. The woes which
the defenseless inhabitants endured from the routed army in its
flight no pen can adequately describe.</p>

<p>An eye-witness writes from near Weissenfels, in a report to
the King of Poland, whose allies the French were, and whose
territories they were ravaging:</p>

<p>“The French army so handled this place as not only to take
from its inhabitants, by open force, all bread and articles of food,
but likewise all clothes, bed-linens, and other portable goods.
They also broke open, split to pieces, and emptied out all chests,
boxes, presses, drawers; shot dead in the back-yards and on the
roofs all manner of feathered stock, as hens, geese, pigeons. They
carried off all swine, cows, sheep, and horses. They laid violent
hands on the inhabitants, clapped swords, guns, and pistols to
their breasts, threatening to kill them unless they brought out
whatever goods they had; or hunted them out of their houses,
shooting at them, cutting, sticking, and at last driving them away,
thereby to have freer room to rob and plunder. They flung out
hay and other harvest stock into the mud, and had it trampled
to ruin under the horses’ feet.”</p>

<p>“For a hundred miles around,” writes St. Germain, “the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
is plundered and harried as if fire from heaven had fallen on
it. Scarcely have our plunderers and marauders left the houses
standing.”</p>

<p>This signal achievement raised the military fame of Frederick
higher than ever before. Still it did not perceptibly diminish
the enormous difficulties with which he was environed. Army
after army was marching upon him. Even by a series of successful
battles his forces might be annihilated. But the renown
of the great victory of Rossbach will ever reverberate through
the halls of history.</p>

King to his Troops.—Confidence of the Prussians in their Commander.—Magnificent Array

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">The</span> battle of Rossbach was fought on the 5th of November,
1757. Frederick had but little time to rejoice over his victory.
The Austrians were overrunning Silesia. On the 14th of the
month, the important fortress of Schweidnitz, with all its magazines,
fell into their hands. Then Prince Charles, with sixty
thousand Austrian troops, marched upon Breslau, the principal
city of Silesia, situated on the Oder. The Prince of Bevern held
the place with a little over twenty thousand Prussian troops.
His army was strongly intrenched outside of the walls, under
the guns of the city.</p>

<p>On the 22d of November the Austrians commenced their attack
from five different points. It was a terrific conflict. Sixty
thousand men stormed ramparts defended by twenty thousand
as highly disciplined troops, and as desperate in valor, as ever
stood upon a battle-field. The struggle commenced at three
o’clock in the morning, and raged, over eight miles of country,
until nine o’clock at night. Darkness and utter exhaustion terminated
the conflict. The Austrians had lost, in killed and
wounded, six thousand men, the Prussians eight thousand.</p>

<p>Prince Bevern, aware that the battle would be renewed upon
the morrow, and conscious that he could not sustain another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
such struggle, withdrew with his Prussian troops in the night,
through the silent streets of Breslau, to the other side of the
Oder, leaving eighty cannon behind him. The next morning, in
visiting one of the outposts, he was surprised by a party of the
Austrians and taken prisoner. It was reported that, fearing the
wrath of the king, he had voluntarily allowed himself to be captured.
General Kyau, the next in rank, took the command.
He rapidly retreated. Breslau, thus left to its fate, surrendered,
with its garrison of four thousand men, ninety-eight pieces of
cannon, and vast magazines filled with stores of war. The next
day was Sunday. Te Deums were chanted by the triumphant
Austrians in the Catholic churches in Breslau, and thanks were
offered to God that Maria Theresa had reconquered Silesia, and
that “our ancient sovereigns are restored to us.”</p>

<p>These were terrible tidings for Frederick. The news reached
him at Gorlitz when on the rapid march toward Silesia. Prince
Charles had between eighty and ninety thousand Austrian troops
in the reconquered province. Frederick seemed to be marching
to certain and utter destruction, as, with a feeble band of but
about twenty thousand men, he pressed forward, declaring, “I
will attack them if they stand on the steeples of Breslau.”</p>

<p>On the evening of the 3d of December, 1757, the king arrived
at Parchwitz, in the heart of Silesia, about thirty miles from
Breslau. Here the wreck of Prince Bevern’s army joined him.
Thus re-enforced, he could bring about thirty thousand men into
the field. He immediately, in the night, assembled his principal
officers, and thus addressed them; the words were taken down
at the time. We give this characteristic address slightly abbreviated:</p>

<p>“My friends, the disasters which have befallen us here are not
unknown to you. Schweidnitz is lost. The Prince of Bevern is
beaten. Breslau is gone, and all our war-stores there. A large
part of Silesia is lost. Indeed, my embarrassments would be insuperable
were it not that I have boundless trust in you. There
is hardly one among you who has not distinguished himself by
some memorable action. All these services I well know, and
shall never forget.</p>

<p>“I flatter myself that now nothing will be wanting of that
valor which the state has a right to expect of you. The hour is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
at hand. I should feel that I had accomplished nothing were I
to leave Silesia in the hands of Austria. Let me then apprise
you that I intend to attack Prince Charles’s army, which is nearly
thrice the strength of our own, wherever I can find it. It
matters not what are his numbers, or what the strength of his
position. All this by courage and by skill we will try to overcome.
This step I must risk, or all is lost. We must beat the
enemy, or perish before his batteries. If there be any one who
shrinks from sharing these dangers with me, he can have his discharge
this evening.”</p>

<p>The king paused. A general murmur of applause indicated
the united resolve to conquer or to die. Frederick immediately
added:</p>

<p>“Yes, I knew it. Not one of you will forsake me. I rely
upon your help and upon victory as sure. The cavalry regiment
that does not, on the instant, on order given, dash full plunge
into the enemy, I will directly after the battle unhorse, and make
it a garrison regiment. The infantry battalion which, meet with
what it may, shows the least sign of hesitating, loses its colors
and its sabres, and I cut the trimmings from its uniform.</p>

<p>“I shall be in the front and in the rear of the army. I shall
fly from one wing to the other. No squadron and no company
will escape my observation. Those who act well I will reward,
and will never forget them. We shall soon either have beaten
the enemy or we shall see each other no more.”</p>

<p>After this address to the assembled generals Frederick rode
out to the camp, and addressed each regiment in the most familiar
and fatherly, yet by no means exultant terms. It was night.
The glare of torches shed a lurid light upon the scene. The first
regiment the king approached was composed of the cuirassiers
of the Life Guard.</p>

<p>“Well, my children,” said Frederick, “how do you think that it
will be with us now? The Austrians are twice as strong as we.”</p>

<p>“Never you mind that,” they replied. “The Austrians are
not Prussians. You know what we can do.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do,” the king responded. “Otherwise I durst not
risk a battle. And now, my children, a good night’s sleep to
you. We shall soon attack the enemy; and we shall beat him,
or we shall all die.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
“Yes, death or victory,” they shouted. Then from loving lips
the cheer ran along the line, “Good-night, Fritz.”</p>

<p>And thus the king passed from regiment to regiment. Perhaps
no commander, excepting Napoleon, has ever secured to an
equal degree the love of his soldiers. It is said that a deserter
was brought before him.</p>

<p>“What induced you to desert me?” inquired the king.</p>

<p>“Alas! your majesty,” the man replied, “we are so few, and
the Austrians are so many, that defeat is certain.”</p>

<p>“Well,” the king replied, kindly, “try it one day more. If we
do not mend matters, you and I will both desert together.”</p>

<p>The Austrian army, which outnumbered the Prussian over
three to one, was in a camp, very strongly fortified, near Breslau.
A council of war was held. Some of the Austrian officers, dreading
the prowess of their redoubtable opponent, advised that they
should remain behind their intrenchments, and await an attack.
It would, of course, be impossible for less than thirty thousand
men to storm ramparts bristling with artillery, and defended by
nearly ninety thousand highly disciplined and veteran troops.</p>

<p>Others, however, urged that this was ignoble and cowardly;
that it would expose them to the derision of the world if they,
with their overwhelming numbers, were to take shelter behind
their ramparts, fearing to attack so feeble a band. Prince
Charles, anxious to regain lost reputation, and elated by the reconquest
of Silesia, adopted the more heroic resolve, and marched
out to meet the foe.</p>

<p>With great joy Frederick learned that the Austrians had left
their camp, and were on the advance to attack him. He immediately
put his little army in motion for the perilous and decisive
conflict. It was four o’clock Sunday morning, December 4,
1757, when Frederick left Parchwitz on his march toward Breslau.
He was familiar with every square mile of the region.
The Austrians were so vastly superior in numbers that many of
them quite despised the weakness of the Prussian army. Many
jokes were tossed about in the Austrian camp respecting the
feeble band of Frederick, which they contemptuously called the
“Potsdam Guard.”</p>

<p>The Austrians, on the careless and self-confident march toward
Parchwitz, had crossed the Schweidnitz River, or Water, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
was called, when they learned that Frederick, with a tiger-like
spring, had leaped upon Neumarkt, an important town fourteen
miles from Parchwitz. Here the Austrians had a bakery, protected
by a guard of a thousand men. Seven hundred of the
guard were instantly sabred or taken prisoners. The rest fled
wildly. Frederick gathered up eighty thousand hot bread rations,
with which he feasted his hungry troops.</p>

<div id="ip_438" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_438.jpg" width="600" height="544" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">MAP OF THE LEUTHEN CAMPAIGN.</div></div>

<p>Early on Monday morning the Prussians advanced from Neumarkt,
eight miles, to Borne. Here they met the advance-guard
of the Austrian cavalry. It was a dark, foggy morning. Frederick,
as usual, was with his vanguard. Almost before the
Austrians were conscious of the presence of the foe, they were
assailed, with the utmost impetuosity, in front and on both their
flanks. Instantly they were thrown into utter confusion. The
ground was covered with their dead. Their general, Nostitz,
was fatally wounded, and died the next day. Five hundred and
forty were taken prisoners. The bleeding, breathless remnant
fled pell-mell back to the main body, a few miles in the rear.</p>

<p>Frederick, pressing forward directly east, toward Leuthen, ascended
an eminence, the height of Scheuberg, whence he beheld,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
directly before him, the whole majestic Austrian army. It extended
for a distance of about five miles, drawn up in battle-array
across his path, from the village of Nypern on the north,
through Leuthen, to the village of Sagschütz on the south. So
distinctly were their military lines spread out before the eye
that Frederick, with his glass, could count them, man by man.
Carefully the king studied the position of the enemy, and formed
his plan of attack. He designed, while bewildering the Austrians
by his manœuvres, to direct the whole concentrated
strength of his army upon their extreme left wing. He hoped
thus, by the desperate impetuosity of his attack, to roll that
whole left wing together in utter ruin before the centre or the
right could come to its aid. He would then press on, with numbers
ever overpowering the Austrians at the point of attack, until
the whole line, five miles in length, was annihilated.</p>

<p>An eye-witness thus describes the tactics by which Frederick
executed his design: “It is a particular manœuvre which, up to
the present time, none but Prussian troops can execute with the
precision and velocity indispensable to it. You divide your line
into many pieces. You can push these forward stair-wise, so
that they shall halt close to one another. Forming itself in this
way, a mass of troops takes up in proportion very little ground.
And it shows in the distance, by reason of the mixed uniforms
and standards, a totally chaotic mass of men, heaped one on another.
But it needs only that the commander lift his finger, and
instantly this living coil of knotted intricacies develops itself in
perfect order, and with a speed like that of mountain rivers.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>“It was a beautiful sight,” writes Tempelhof. “The heads of
the columns were constantly on the same level, and at the distance
necessary for forming. All flowed on exact as if in a review.
And you could read in the eyes of our brave troops the
temper they were in.”</p>

<p>As they marched their voices burst forth simultaneously in a
German hymn. The gush of their rude and many-voiced melody
was borne distinctly on the wind to the eminence where Frederick
stood, anxiously watching those movements which were to

<p>These solemn tones of sacred psalmody fell impressively upon
the ear of the king when his earthly all was trembling in the
balance. Religionless and atheistic as he was, he could not repress
some visible emotion. One of his officers, aware of the
king’s avowed contempt for every thing of a religious nature, inquired,</p>

<p>“Shall we order that to cease, your majesty?”</p>

<p>“By no means,” the king replied. “With men like these I
shall be sure of victory to-day!”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>The field of Leuthen—for so this battle-field was called—was
a vast undulating plain or rolling prairie, extending for miles in
all directions. One or two brooks flowed sluggishly through it.
Here and there were expanses of marsh which neither horse nor
foot could traverse. A few scraggy firs dotted the dreary landscape,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
and there were also a few hamlets of peasants’ huts scattered
around. Frederick concealed his movements as much as possible
behind the undulations, and succeeded in deceiving the
Austrians into the belief that he was to make an attack upon
their <em>right</em> wing. The Austrian officers, on windmills and in
church belfries, were eagerly scrutinizing his manœuvres. Deceived
into the conviction that their right wing was menaced,
they impetuously pushed forward large re-enforcements of horse
to the support of the presumed point of attack. Thus the left
wing was weakened.</p>

<p>Frederick, who had taken his position upon a windmill, saw,
with much satisfaction, the successful operation of his plan.
Suddenly, with almost miraculous swiftness of movement, his
perfectly drilled troops, horse, foot, and artillery, every man reckless
of life, poured forth with a rush and a roar as of a lava-flood
upon the extreme left of the Austrians. It was one o’clock of
the day. There was neither brook, bush, fence, nor marsh to impede
the headlong impetuosity of the assault. At the point of
attack the Prussians were, of course, most numerous. There
were a few moments of terrible slaughter, and the left wing of
the Austrian army was annihilated. The ground was covered
with the wounded and the dead, and the fugitives, in dismay,
were fleeing across the fields.</p>

<p>The Austrian centre was pushed rapidly forward to the aid
of the discomfited left. It was too late. The soldiers arrived
upon the ground breathless and in disorder. Before they had
time to form, Frederick plowed their ranks with balls, swept
them with bullets, and fell upon them mercilessly with sabre
and bayonet. The carnage was awful. Division after division
melted away in the fire deluge which consumed them. Prince
Charles made the most desperate efforts to rally his dismayed
troops in and around the church-yard at Leuthen. Here for an
hour they fought desperately. But it was all in vain. The left
wing was destroyed. The centre was destroyed. The right
wing was pushed forward only to be cut to pieces by the sabres,
and to be mown down by the terrific fire of the triumphant Prussians.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the conflict upon the extreme left commenced ere
it was evident that by the military sagacity of Frederick the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
doom of the Austrian army was sealed. With thirty thousand
men he had attacked ninety thousand on the open field, and was
utterly overwhelming them. An Austrian officer, Prince De
Ligne, describing the battle, writes:</p>

<p>“Cry had risen for the reserve, and that it must come on as
fast as possible. We ran at our utmost speed. Our lieutenant
colonel fell, killed, at the first. Then we lost our major, and, indeed,
all the officers but three. We had crossed two successive
ditches which lay in an orchard to the left of the first houses in
Leuthen, and were beginning to form in front of the village. But
there was no standing it. Besides a general cannonade, such as
can scarcely be imagined, there was a rain of case-shot upon this
battalion, of which I had to take command. A Prussian battalion
at the distance of eighty paces gave the liveliest fire upon
us. It stood as if on the parade-ground, and waited for us without
stirring. My soldiers, who were tired with running, and
had no cannon, soon became scattered. At last, when I had but
two hundred left, I drew back to the height where the windmill
is.”</p>

<p>Before the sun went down the Austrian army was every where
flying from the field in hopeless confusion. Their rush was in
four torrents toward the east, to reach the bridges which crossed
the Schweidnitz Water. There were four of them. One was on
the main road at Lissa; one a mile north at Stabelwitz; and two
on the south, one at Goldschmieden, and the other at Hermannsdorf.
The victory of Frederick was one of the most memorable
in the annals of war. The Austrians lost in killed and wounded
ten thousand men. Twenty-one thousand were taken prisoners.
This was a heavier loss in numbers than the whole army
of Frederick. The victors also took fifty-one flags, and a hundred
and sixteen cannon.</p>

<p>As the king cast his eye over the blood-stained field, covered
with the wounded and the dead, for a moment he seemed overcome
with the aspect of misery, and exclaimed, “When, oh when
will my woes cease?”</p>

<p>“My children,” said Frederick that night at parole, “after such
a day’s work you deserve rest. This day will send the renown
of your name and that of the nation down to the latest posterity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
He did not order the exhausted troops to pursue the foe.
Still, as he rode along the line after dark, he inquired,</p>

<p>“Is there any battalion which has a mind to follow me to
Lissa?”</p>

<p>Three volunteered. It was so dark that the landlord of a little
country inn walked with a lantern by the side of Frederick’s
horse. Lissa was on the main road to Breslau. The landlord
supposed that he was guiding one of Frederick’s generals, and
was very communicative.</p>

<p>“Yesterday noon,” said he, “I had Prince Charles in my parlor.
His adjutants and people were all crowding about. Such
a questioning and bothering. Hundreds came dashing in, and
other hundreds were sent out. In and out they went all night.
No sooner was one gone than ten came. I had to keep a roaring
fire in the kitchen all night, so many officers were crowding
to it to warm themselves. They talked and babbled. One
would say that our king was marching upon them with his Potsdam
parade guard. Another would say, ‘No, he dare not come.
He will turn and run.’ But my delight is that our king has
paid them for their fooleries so prettily this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“When did you get rid of your guests?” inquired the king.</p>

<p>“About nine this morning,” was the reply, “the prince got to
horse. Not long after three he came back again with a swarm
of officers, all going full speed for Lissa. They were full of bragging
when they came; now they were off wrong side foremost!
I saw how it was. Close following after him the flood of them
ran. The high road was not broad enough. It was an hour
and more before it ended. Such a pell-mell, such a welter! cavalry
and infantry all jumbled together. Our king must have
given them a terrible flogging.”</p>

<p>When the king reached Lissa he found the village full of Austrian
officers and soldiers in a state of utter disorganization and
confusion. Had the Austrians known their strength or the weakness
of the king, they might easily have taken him captive.
Frederick was somewhat alarmed. He, however, assumed a bold
front, and rode to the principal house in the town, which was a
little one side of the main street. The house was crowded with
Austrian officers, bustling about, seeking lodgings for the night.
The king stepped in with a slight escort, and said gayly,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
“Good evening, gentlemen, good evening. Can you make room
for me here, do you think?”</p>

    <div class="caption">THE KING IN SEARCH OF LODGINGS.</div></div>

<p>The astounded Austrians bowed to the dust before him, escorted
him to the best room, and, stealing out into the darkness,
made their way as rapidly as possible to the bridge, which at
the east end of the street crossed the Schweidnitz Water. At
the farther end of the bridge Austrian cannon were planted to
arrest the pursuit. The officers hurried across, and vanished in
the gloom of night, followed by the river-guard. The Prussian
cannoneers steadily pursued, and kept up through the night an
incessant fire upon the rear of the foe.</p>

<p>The night was very dark and cold. A wintry wind swept the
bleak, frozen fields. Still the routed Austrians pressed on. Still
the tireless Prussians pursued. The Prussian soldiers were Protestants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
Many of them were well instructed in religion. As
they pressed on through the gloom, sweeping the road before
them with artillery discharges, their voices simultaneously burst
forth into a well-known Church hymn, a sort of Protestant <cite>Te
Deum</cite>—</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Now thank God, one and all,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Early in the morning Frederick’s whole army was on the rapid
march for Breslau, which was scarcely twenty miles distant from
the battle-field. The Austrians had collected immense military
stores in the city. Prince Charles, as he fled through the place
with the wreck of his army, left a garrison of seventeen thousand
men for its defense. In a siege of twelve days, during which
there was an incessant bombardment and continual assaults, the
city was carried. A few days after this, Liegnitz, which the Austrians
had strongly fortified, was also surrendered to the victor.
Frederick had thus reconquered the whole of Silesia excepting
the single fortress of Schweidnitz.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">The</span> army of Prince Charles was so utterly destroyed or dispersed
by the battle of Leuthen that the morning after his terrible
defeat he could rally around his banners, by count, but fifty
thousand men. These were utterly disheartened. Stragglers
were wandering all over the country. A few thousand of these
again joined the ranks. Seventeen thousand men left in Breslau
were soon captured. Prince Charles, abandoning guns and wagons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
fled through rain, and mud, and sleet directly south toward
Königgrätz, in Bohemia. The sufferings of the troops were awful.
Several hundred sentinels, in one night, were frozen stiff at
their posts. The dreadful retreat continued for ten days.</p>

<p>“The army,” writes Prince Charles, mournfully, “was greatly
dilapidated. The soldiers were without clothes, and in a condition
truly pitiable. So closely were we pursued by the enemy
that at night we were compelled to encamp without tents.”</p>

<p>Having reached the shelter of Königgrätz, he counted his
troops, and found that he had in rank and file but thirty-seven
thousand men. Of these, twenty-two thousand, from sickness,
exhaustion, and wounds, were in hospital. Thus, out of the army
of ninety thousand men with which he had commenced the campaign
early in December, at the close of the month he could array
but fifteen thousand on any field of battle.</p>

<p>The astonishment and indignation in Vienna, in view of this
terrible defeat, were intense. Prince Charles was immediately
relieved of his command, and General Daun appointed in his
stead. It is the testimony of all military men that the battle of
Leuthen was one of the most extraordinary feats of war. Napoleon,
speaking of it at St. Helena, said,</p>

<p>“This battle is a masterpiece of movements, of manœuvres,
and of resolution. It is enough to immortalize Frederick, and
to rank him among the greatest generals. It develops, in the
highest degree, both his moral and his military qualities.”</p>

<p>Voltaire, in summing up a sketch of this campaign of 1757,
writes in characteristic phrase:</p>

<p>“Even Gustavus Adolphus never did such great things. One
must, indeed, pardon Frederick his verses, his sarcasms, and his
little malices. All the faults of the man disappear before the
glory of the hero.”</p>

<p>On the 19th of December, the day of the capitulation of Breslau,
Frederick wrote from that place to his friend D’Argens as
follows:</p>

<p>“Your friendship seduces you, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon cher</i>. I am but a paltry
knave in comparison with Alexander, and not worthy to tie the
shoe-latchets of Cæsar. Necessity, who is the mother of industry,
has made me act, and have recourse to desperate remedies in
evils of a like nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
“We have taken here from fourteen to fifteen thousand prisoners.
In all, I have above twenty-three thousand of the queen’s
troops in my hands, fifteen generals, and above seven hundred
officers. It is a plaster on my wounds, but it is far enough from
healing them.”</p>

<p>It was now midwinter. Frederick, having established his
troops in winter quarters, took up his residence in Breslau. His
troubles were by no means ended. Vastly outnumbering foes
still surrounded him. Very vigorous preparations were to be
made for the sanguinary conflicts which the spring would surely
introduce. Frederick did what he could to infuse gayety into
the society at Breslau, though he had but little heart to enter
into those gayeties himself. For a week he suffered severely
from colic pains, and could neither eat nor sleep. “Eight
months,” he writes, “of anguish and agitation do wear one down.”</p>

<p>His sister Amelia and several other friends visited him at
Breslau. Among others was his reader, Henry de Catt.</p>

<p>“Should you have known me?” the king inquired of De Catt.</p>

<p>“Hardly,” he replied, “in that dress. Besides, your majesty
has grown thinner.”</p>

<p>“That may well be,” rejoined the king, “with the cursed life
I have been leading.”</p>

<p>Frederick still sought recreation in writing verses which he
called poetry. To D’Argens he wrote, “I have made a prodigious
quantity of verses. If I live I will show them to you. If
I perish they are bequeathed to you, and I have ordered that they
be put into your hand.”</p>

<p>Again he wrote D’Argens on the 26th of December, “What a
pleasure to hear that you are coming. I have sent a party of
light horse to conduct you. You can make short journeys. I
have directed that horses be ordered for you, that your rooms be
warmed every where, and good fowls ready on all roads. Your
apartment in this house is carpeted, hermetically shut. You
shall suffer nothing from draughts or from noise.”</p>

<p>Frederick, having regained Silesia, was anxious for peace. He
wrote a polite letter to Maria Theresa, adroitly worded, so as to
signify that desire without directly expressing it. The empress
queen, disheartened by the disasters of Rossbach and Leuthen,
was rather inclined to listen to such suggestions; but the Duchess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
of Pompadour verified the adage that “hell has no fury like
a woman scorned.” She governed the wretched Louis XV., and
through him governed France. In her intense personal exasperation
against Frederick she would heed no terms of compromise,
and infused new energy into all warlike operations. Large subsidies
were paid by France to Austria, Sweden, and Russia, to
prepare for the campaign of 1758.</p>

<p>Frederick was soon aware that peace was out of the question
without farther fighting. Before the 1st of April he had one
hundred and forty-five thousand men ready for the field. Of
these, fifty-three thousand were in Silesia. Many of the Austrian
deserters were induced to join his standards. But the most
important event secured was forming a subsidy treaty with England.
The British cabinet, alarmed in view of the power which
the successful prosecution of the war on the part of the allies
would give to France, after much hesitation, came to the aid of
Frederick, whom they hated as much as they feared France. On
the 11th of April, 1758, a treaty was signed between the English
court and Frederick, containing the following important item:</p>

<p>“That Frederick shall have six hundred and seventy thousand
pounds ($3,350,000), payable in London to his order, in October,
this year, which sum Frederick engages to spend wholly in the
maintenance and increase of his army for behoof of the common
object; neither party to dream of making the least shadow of
peace or truce without the other.”</p>

<p>Schweidnitz was strictly blockaded during the winter. On
the 15th of March, the weather being still cold, wet, and stormy,
Frederick marched from Breslau to attack the place. His siege
artillery was soon in position. With his accustomed impetuosity
he commenced the assault, and, after a terrific bombardment
of many days, on the night of the 15th of April took the works
by storm. The garrison, which had dwindled from eight thousand
to four thousand five hundred, was all captured, with fifty-one
guns, thirty-five thousand dollars of money, and a large
quantity of stores. Thus the whole of Silesia was again in the
hands of Frederick.</p>

<p>It was supposed that his Prussian majesty would now march
southwest for the invasion of Bohemia. Austria made vigorous
preparations to meet him there. Much to the surprise and bewilderment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
of the Austrians, the latter part of April Frederick
directed his columns toward the southeast. His army, about
forty thousand strong, was in two divisions. By a rapid march
through Neisse and Jagerndorf he reached Troppau, on the extreme
southern frontier of Silesia. He then turned to the southwest.
It was again supposed that he intended to invade Bohemia,
but from the east instead of from the north.</p>

<p>General Daun, in command of the Austrian forces, rapidly
concentrated his troops around Leutomischel, where he had extensive
magazines. But Frederick, leaving Leutomischel far
away on his right, pressed forward in a southerly direction, and
on the 12th of May appeared before Olmütz. His march had
been rapidly and admirably conducted, dividing his troops into
columns for the convenience of road and subsistence.</p>

<p>Olmütz was an ancient, strongly fortified city of Moravia,
pleasantly situated on the western banks of the Morawa River.
It had been the capital of Moravia, and contained about ten
thousand inhabitants. The place subsequently became renowned
from the imprisonment of Lafayette in its citadel for many
years. The city had become an arsenal, and one of the most important
military store-houses of Austria.</p>

<p>Olmütz was ninety miles from Troppau, in Silesia, where Frederick
had established his base of supplies. This was a long line
of communication to protect. General Daun, with a numerous
Austrian army, all whose movements were veiled by clouds of
those fleet and shaggy horsemen called Pandours, was forty miles
to the west, at Leutomischel. Cautious in the extreme, nothing
could draw him into a general battle. But he watched his foe
with an eagle eye, continually assailing his line of communication,
and ever ready to strike his heaviest blows upon any exposed
point.</p>

<p>The king’s brother Henry was in command in Saxony, at the
head of thirty thousand troops. Frederick wrote to him the
characteristic and very judicious advice, “Do as energetically as
possible whatever seems wisest to <em>you</em>. But hold no councils
of war.”</p>

<p>The plan of his Prussian majesty was bold and sagacious.
He supposed that he could easily take Olmütz. Availing himself
of the vast magazines to be found there, he would summon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
his brother Henry to join him by a rapid march through Bohemia,
and with their combined force of sixty thousand troops they
would make a rush upon Vienna. The Austrian capital was
distant but about one hundred miles, directly south. As the
Austrian army was widely dispersed, there were but few impediments
to be encountered. The success of this plan would compel
the allies to withdraw their forces from the territories of the
King of Prussia, if it did not enable Frederick to dictate peace
in the palaces of Maria Theresa.</p>

<p>Olmütz was found very strongly fortified. It was so situated
that, with the force Frederick had, it could not be entirely invested.
Baron Marshal, a very brave and energetic old man,
sixty-seven years of age, conducted the defense.</p>

<p>His garrison consisted of about fourteen thousand infantry
and six hundred dragoons. General Daun was at the distance
of but two marches, with a larger Austrian force than Frederick
commanded. Nothing can more clearly show the dread with
which the Austrians regarded their antagonist than the fact that
General Daun did not march immediately upon Olmütz, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
with the aid of a sally from the garrison, overwhelm and crush
Frederick beneath their united assaults.</p>

<p>For seven weeks the siege of Olmütz was prosecuted with
great vigor. With much skill Frederick protected his baggage
trains in their long and exposed route of ninety miles through
forests and mountain defiles. General Keith was intrusted with
the details of the siege facing the town toward the east; Frederick,
with a vigilant corps of horse and foot, was about twenty
miles to the west, watching every movement of General Daun,
so far as he was able through the thick cloud of Pandours, behind
which the Austrian commander endeavored to conceal all
his manœuvres.</p>

<p>While engaged in these labors the tidings reached him of the
death of his brother Augustus William. He was Prince of Prussia,
being, next to the childless Frederick, heir to the crown.
Frederick seems to have received the news very heartlessly.</p>

<p>“Of what did he die?” he coldly inquired of the messenger.</p>

<p>“Of chagrin, your majesty,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Frederick turned upon his heel, and made no answer.</p>

<p>The unhappy Prince of Prussia, on his dying bed, wrote a
very touching letter to his brother Frederick, remonstrating
against his conduct, which was not only filling Europe with
blood and misery, but which was also imperiling the existence
of the Prussian kingdom.</p>

<p>“The slow fever,” he wrote, “which consumes me, has not
thrown any disorder into my understanding. Condescend to
listen to me, sire, now that I can not be suspected of any illusion
or deceit. There is an end to the house of Prussia if you continue
to brave all Europe confederated against you. You force
all Europe to arm to repel your encroachments. The princes of
Europe are leagued against your majesty by justice and by interest.
Their subjects regard your ruin as essential to the re-establishment
of peace and the safety of monarchical government.
They read in your success the slavery of the human race, the annihilation
of laws, the degradation of society.”</p>

<p>In reference to the course which the king had allowed himself
to pursue in obtaining access to the archives of Saxony by bribing
an officer to betray his trust, Augustus William wrote:</p>

<p>“The more you have proved that you were acquainted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
the intentions of Saxony, the more odious have you rendered its
invasion. In order to procure this knowledge, your minister has
degraded his character. By means proscribed in society, you
have discovered only that the King Elector of Saxony did not
love the power of Prussia, that he feared it, and that he even
dared to form projects to defend himself against it. Documents
which are stolen make against the accuser who produces them,
if they do not prove the crime which they impute.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>In conclusion, in most pathetic terms he entreated the king to
listen to terms of peace, and thus to prevent the ruin of himself,
of his people, and of his royal house.</p>

<p>At the same time that the tidings of the death of Augustus
William were communicated to the king, he received also the
tidings, which to him were truly heart-rending, that Wilhelmina,
worn down with care and sorrow, was fast sinking into the grave.</p>

<p>Early in June, the cautious but ever-vigilant General Daun
succeeded in throwing into Olmütz a re-enforcement of eleven
hundred Austrian troops. They were guided by peasants through
by-paths in the forests. Crossing the river some miles below
Olmütz, they entered the city from the east.</p>

<p>Still, on the whole, the siege progressed favorably. Large supplies
of food and ammunition were indispensable to Frederick.
Thirty thousand hungry men were to be fed. A constant bombardment
rapidly exhausts even abundant stores of powder,
shot, and shell.</p>

<p>In the latter part of June a large train of over three thousand
four-horse wagons, laden with all necessary supplies, left Troppau
for Olmütz. It is difficult for a reader unfamiliar with such
scenes to form any conception of the magnitude of such an enterprise.
There are twelve thousand horses to be shod, harnessed,
and fed, and watered three or four times a day. There are
three thousand wagons to be kept in repair, rattling over the
stones and plowing through the mire. Six thousand teamsters
are required. There is invariably connected with such a movement
one or two thousand camp-followers, sutlers, women, vagabonds.
A large armed force is also needed to act as convoy.</p>

<p>This train filled the road for a distance of twenty miles. To
traverse the route of ninety miles required six days. The road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
led through forests and mountain defiles. A bold and vigorous
foe, well equipped and well mounted, watched the movement.
To protect such a train from assault is one of the most difficult
achievements of war. The enemy, suddenly emerging from
mountain fastnesses or gloomy forests, can select his point of attack,
and then sweep in either direction along the line, burning
and destroying.</p>

<p>On the 26th of June this vast train commenced its movement
from Troppau. A convoy of about seven thousand infantry and
eleven hundred cavalry guarded the wagons. They were in
three bodies, on the front, in the centre, and on the rear. The
king also sent forward about six thousand horse and foot from
Olmütz to meet the train.</p>

<p>The wagons had accomplished about half the distance, when,
on Friday, the 30th of June, as they were emerging from wild
ravines among the mountains, they were simultaneously attacked
in front, centre, and rear by three divisions of the Austrians, each
about five thousand strong. Then ensued as terrible a scene of
panic and confusion as war has ever witnessed. The attack of
horsemen with their gleaming sabres, the storm of bullets, thick
as hailstones, the thunders of the cannon, as the ponderous balls
tore their way through wagons, and horses, and men, soon presented
such a spectacle of devastation, ruin, and woe as mortal
eyes have seldom gazed upon.</p>

<p>“Among the tragic wrecks of this convoy there is one that still
goes to our heart. A longish, almost straight row of Prussian
recruits stretched among the slain, what are these? These were
seven hundred recruits coming up from their cantons to the wars.
See how they have fought to the death, poor lads! and have honorably,
on the sudden, got manumitted from the toils of life.
Seven hundred of them stood to arms this morning; some sixty-five
will get back to Troppau; that is the invoice account. There
they lie with their blonde young cheeks, beautiful in death.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p>A large portion of the train was utterly destroyed. The remainder
was driven back to Troppau. The disaster was irreparable.
The tidings were conveyed to Frederick the next day,
July 1. They must have fallen upon him with crushing weight.
It was the annihilation of all his hopes for the campaign, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
rendered it necessary immediately to raise the siege and retreat.
This extraordinary man did not allow himself to manifest the
slightest despondency. He assembled his officers, and, with a
smiling face, and hopeful, cheering words, announced his decision.</p>

<p>All Saturday night the bombardment was continued with increasing
fury. In the mean time four thousand wagons were
packed, and, long before the dawn of Sunday morning, were on
the road. The retreat was so admirably conducted that General
Daun did not venture even to attempt to harass the retiring
columns. Instead of moving in a northerly direction to Silesia,
Frederick directed his march to the northwest, into Bohemia.
On the 8th of July his long column safely reached Leutomischel.
He there seized quite an amount of military stores, which General
Daun, in his haste and bewilderment, had not been able to
remove or to destroy. Five more marches conducted him to
Königgrätz.</p>

<p>General Daun, with the utmost caution, followed the retreating
army. Though his numbers were estimated at seventy-five
thousand, he did not dare to encounter Frederick with his thirty
thousand Prussians on the field of battle. With skill which has
elicited the applause of all military critics, Frederick, early in
August, continued his retreat till he reached, on the 8th of the
month, Grüssau, on his own side of the mountains in Silesia. On
this march he wrote to his brother Henry from Skalitz:</p>

<p>“What you write to me of my sister of Baireuth makes me
tremble. Next to my mother, she is the one I have most tenderly
loved in this world. She is a sister who has my heart and
all my confidence, and whose character is of a price beyond all
the crowns in the universe. From my tenderest years I was
brought up with her. You can conceive how there reigns between
us that indissoluble bond of mutual affection and attachment
for life which in many cases were impossible. Would to
Heaven that I might die before her!”</p>

<p>On the 9th of August he wrote from Grüssau to Wilhelmina
herself: “Oh, you, the dearest of my family, you whom I have
most at heart of all in this world, for the sake of whatever is
most precious to you, preserve yourself, and let me have at least
the consolation of shedding my tears in your bosom!”</p>

<p>Frederick had left Grüssau on the 18th of April for his Moravian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
campaign. He returned on the 8th of August, after an absence
of sixteen weeks. The campaign had proved an entire
failure. A Russian army, fifty thousand strong, under General
Fermor, had invaded Brandenburg, just beyond the extreme
northern frontier of Silesia. These semi-barbarian soldiers had
burned the town of Cüstrin, on the Oder, were besieging the
small garrison in its citadel, and were committing the most horrid
outrages upon the community around, not only plundering
and burning, but even consigning captives to the flames.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 11th of August, Frederick, leaving forty thousand
men to guard Silesia, took fifteen thousand troops, and commenced
a very rapid march to attack the fifty thousand Russians.
Upon the eve of his departure he wrote to his brother Henry:</p>

<p>“I march to-morrow against the Russians. As the events of
war may lead to all sorts of accidents, and it may easily happen
to me to be killed, I have thought it my duty to let you know
what my plans were; the rather, as you are the guardian of my
nephew,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> with unlimited authority.”</p>

<p>He then gave minute directions as to what he wished to have
done in case of his death. Marching rapidly through Liegnitz
and Hohenfriedberg, he reached Frankfort-on-the-Oder on Sunday,
the 20th of August. He was now within twenty miles of
Cüstrin, and the bombardment by the heavy siege guns of the
Russians could be distinctly heard. Frederick took lodgings at
the house of a clergyman’s widow. Frequently he arose and
went out of doors, listening impatiently to the cannonade. An
eye-witness writes:</p>

<p>“I observed that the king took a pinch of snuff as the sound
of each discharge reached him. And even through that air of
intrepidity, which never abandoned this prince, I could perceive
the sensations of pity toward that unfortunate town, and an
eager impatience to fly to its relief.”</p>

<p>The next morning, taking with him a small escort, and leaving
his army to follow with as much speed as possible, he rode rapidly
down the western bank of the Oder to Görgast, where he
had an encampment of about fifteen thousand Prussian troops.
At five o’clock in the morning of Tuesday the two bands were
united. He now had at his command thirty thousand men.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
Cüstrin was on the eastern bank of the Oder, near the confluence
of the Warta. A few miles below Cüstrin, at Schaumburg, there
were portions of a bridge across the Oder. Here the Russians
had erected a redoubt. Frederick ordered a violent attack upon
that redoubt. During the night, while the attention of the Russians
was occupied by the assault, Frederick marched his army
twelve miles farther down the river, and crossed, without any
loss, at Güstebiese. His baggage train he left, carefully guarded,
on the western bank of the river.</p>

<p>Pressing straight forward, Wednesday morning, to the east, he
encamped that night about ten miles from Güstebiese. He had
so successfully veiled his movements that the Russians knew not
where he was. On Thursday morning, August 24, at an early
hour, he resumed his march, and crossed the Mützel River at various
points. His confidence of victory was so great that he destroyed
all the bridges behind him to prevent the retreat of the
Russians.</p>

<p>General Fermor was now informed, through his roving Cossacks,
of the position of Frederick. Immediately he raised the
siege of Cüstrin, hurried off his baggage train to Klein Kamin,
on the road to Landsberg, and retired with his army to a very
strong position near the village of Zorndorf. Here there was a
wild, bleak, undulating plain, interspersed with sluggish streams,
and forests, and impassable bogs. General Fermor massed the
Russian troops in a very irregular hollow square, with his staff
baggage in the centre, and awaited an attack. This huge quadrilateral
of living lines, four men deep, with bristling bayonets,
prancing horses, and iron-lipped cannon, was about two miles
long by one mile broad.</p>

<p>At half past three o’clock on Friday morning, Frederick, with
his whole army, was again upon the march. He swept quite
around the eastern end of the Russian square, and approached
it from the south. By this sagacious movement he could, in case
of disaster, retreat to Cüstrin.</p>

<p>The morning of a hot August day dawned sultry, the wind
breathing gently from the south. Bands of Cossacks hovered
around upon the wings of the Prussian army, occasionally riding
up to the infantry ranks and discharging their pistols at them.
The Prussians were forbidden to make any reply. “The infantry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
pours along like a plowman drawing his furrow, heedless of the
circling crows.” The Cossacks set fire to Zorndorf. In a few
hours it was in ashes, while clouds of suffocating smoke were
swept through the Russian lines.</p>

<p>The attack was made about eight o’clock, with the whole concentrated
force of the Prussians, upon the southwest wing of the
quadrilateral. The carnage produced by the Prussian batteries,
as their balls swept crosswise through the massed Russians, was
terrible. One cannon-shot struck down forty-two men. For a
moment the Prussians were thrown into confusion by the destructive
fire returned by the foe, and seemed discomfited. The
Russians plunged wildly forward, with loud huzzas. In the eagerness
of their onset their lines were broken.</p>

    <div class="caption">CHARGE OF GENERAL SEIDLITZ AT ZORNDORF.</div></div>

<p>General Seidlitz, with five thousand horsemen, immediately
dashed in among them. Almost in an instant the shouts of victory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
sank away in groans of death. It was an awful scene—a
maelstrom of chaotic tumult, shrieks, blood, and death. The
stolid Russians refused to fly. The Prussians sabred them and
trampled them beneath their horses’ feet until their arms were
weary. This terrible massacre lasted until one o’clock. The
whole of the western portion of the quadrilateral was destroyed.
The Russian soldiers at a little distance from the scene of carnage,
reckless and under poor discipline, broke open the sutlers’
brandy-casks, and were soon beastly drunk. The officers, endeavoring
to restrain them, dashed in many of the casks. The soldiers,
throwing themselves upon the ground, lapped the fiery
liquid from the puddles. They killed many of their own officers,
and became almost unresisting victims of the sabres and bayonets
of their assailants. The Prussians, exasperated by the awful
acts of cruelty which had been perpetrated by the Russians,
showed no mercy. In the midst of the butchery, the word ran
along their lines, “No quarter.”</p>

<p>The eastern half of the immense quadrangle endeavored to reform
itself, so as to present a new front to the foe. But, before
this could be done, Frederick hurled his right wing, his centre,
and all that remained disposable of his left wing upon it. His
cavalry plunged into the disordered mass. His batteries, with
almost unprecedented rapidity of fire, tore the tumultuous and
panic-stricken ranks to shreds; and his line of infantry, like a supernatural
wall of bristling steel, unwaveringly advanced, pouring
in upon the foe the most deadly volleys.</p>

<p>At one moment the Russian horse dashed against this line and
staggered it. Frederick immediately rushed into the vortex to
rally the broken battalions. At the same instant the magnificent
squadrons of Seidlitz, five thousand strong, flushed with victory,
swept like the storm-wind upon the Russian dragoons.
They were whirled back like autumn leaves before the gale.
About four o’clock the firing ceased. The ammunition on both
sides was nearly expended. For some time the Prussians had
been using the cartridge-boxes of the dead Russians.</p>

<p>And now ensued a conflict such as has seldom been witnessed
in modern times. The Russian soldiers would not run. Indeed,
the bridges over the Mützel being broken down, they could only
plunge into the river and be drowned. Frenzied with brandy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
they fought like tigers. “Then began a tug of deadly massacring
and wrestling, man to man, with bayonets, with butts of muskets,
with hands, even with teeth, such as was never seen before. The
shore of Mützel is thick with men and horses, who have tried to
cross, and lie swallowed in the ooze.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>This lasted till nightfall. As darkness veiled the awful scene
the exhausted soldiers dropped upon the ground, and, regardless
of the dead and of the groans of the wounded, borne heavily
upon the night air, slept almost side by side. It is appalling to
reflect upon what a fiend to humanity man has been, as revealed
in the history of the nations. All the woes of earth combined
are as nothing compared with the misery which man has inflicted
upon his brother.</p>

<p>During the night bands of barbarian, half-drunken Cossacks
ranged the field, plundering the wounded and the dead, friends
and foes alike, and thrusting their bayonets through those who
presented any remonstrance, or who might, by any possibility,
call them to account. Four hundred of these wretches the equally
merciless Prussians drove into a barn, fastened them in, set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
fire to the building, and burned them all to ashes. During the
carnage of this bloody day the Russians lost, in killed, wounded,
and missing, 21,539. The Prussians lost 11,390, more than one
third of their number.</p>

<p>General Fermor availed himself of the darkness in withdrawing
his troops, now numbering but 28,000, a mile west from the
battle-field to a dense forest of firs, called Drewitz Heath. Frederick
arranged his little remaining band of but eighteen thousand
men in two lines, facing the foe. The next morning, Saturday,
the 26th, General Fermor sent a request for a truce of three
days to bury the dead. The reply was, “Your proposal is entirely
inadmissible. The victor will bury the slain.” There
was no serious resumption of the conflict on that day. Both
parties were alike exhausted, and had alike expended nearly all
their ammunition. Frederick’s hussars had, however, found out
the position of the Russian baggage train, and had effectually
plundered a large portion of it.</p>

<p>Saturday night was very dark. A thick mist mantled the
landscape. About midnight, the Russians, feigning an artillery
attack upon a portion of the Prussian lines, commenced a retreat.
Groping their way through the woods south of Zorndorf, they
reached the great road to Landsberg, and retreated so rapidly
that Frederick could annoy them but little.</p>

<p>Several well-authenticated anecdotes are given respecting the
conduct of Frederick on this occasion, which illustrate the various
phases in the character of this extraordinary man. The
evening before the battle of Zorndorf, the king, having completed
his arrangements for a conflict against vastly unequal numbers,
upon whose issue were dependent probably both his throne and
his life, sent for a member of his staff of some literary pretensions,
and spent some time in criticising and amending one of the
poems of Rousseau. Was this an affected display of calmness,
the result of vanity? Was it an adroit measure to impress the
officers with a conviction of his own sense of security? Was it
an effort to throw off the terrible pressure which was upon his
mind, as the noble Abraham Lincoln often found it to be a moral
necessity to indulge in a jest even amidst scenes of the greatest
anguish? Whatever may have been the motive, the fact is
worthy of record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
Immediately after the battle Sir Andrew Mitchell called upon
the king to congratulate him upon his great victory. General
Seidlitz, who had led the two decisive cavalry charges, was in
the royal tent. The king, in reply to the congratulations of the
English minister, pointed to General Seidlitz and said,</p>

<p>“Had it not been for him, things would have had a bad look
by this time.”</p>

<p>The town of Cüstrin, it will be remembered, was utterly consumed,
being set on fire by the shells of the Russians. The commandant
of the citadel was censured for not having prevented
the calamity. He immediately sought an interview with the
king, endeavoring to apologize for his conduct. The king, perhaps
justly, perhaps very unjustly, interrupted him, saying,</p>

<p>“I find no fault with you; the blame is entirely my own in
having appointed you to such a post.”</p>

<p>The utter ruin of the town of Cüstrin, and the misery of its
houseless and starving population, seemed to affect the king
deeply. To the inhabitants, who clustered around him, he said,
kindly,</p>

<p>“My children, I could not come to you sooner, or this calamity
should not have happened. Have a little patience, and I will
cause every thing to be rebuilt.”</p>

<p>As has often been mentioned, the carnage of the battle-field
constitutes by no means the greater part of the miseries of war.
One of the sufferers from the conflagration of the city of Cüstrin
gives the following graphic account of the scene. It was the
15th of August, 1758:</p>

<p>“The enemy threw such a multitude of bombs and red-hot
balls into the city that by nine o’clock in the morning it burned,
with great fury, in three different places. The fire could not be
extinguished, as the houses were closely built, and the streets
narrow. The air appeared like a shower of fiery rain and hail.
The surprised inhabitants had not time to think of any thing
but of saving their lives by getting into the open fields.</p>

<p>“I, as well as many others, had hardly time to put on my
clothes. As I was leading my wife, with a young child in her
arms, and my other children and servants before me—who were
almost naked, having, ever since the first fright, run about as
they got out of bed—the bombs and red-hot balls fell round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
about us. The bombs, in their bursting, dashed the houses to
pieces, and every thing that was in their way. Every body that
could got out of the town as fast as possible. The crowd of
naked and in the highest degree wretched people was vastly
great.</p>

<p>“Among the women were many of distinction, who had neither
shoes nor stockings, nor hardly any thing else on, thinking
only of saving their lives. When I had seen my family in the
open field, I endeavored to return and save something, if possible,
but in vain. I could not force my way through the multitude
of people thronging out at the gate, some few with horses and
carriages, and others with the sick and bedridden on their backs.
The bombs and red-hot balls fell so thick that all thought themselves
happy if they could but escape with their lives.</p>

<p>“Many thousands are made miserable, inhabitants as well as
strangers. Many from the open country and defenseless towns
in Prussia, Pomerania, and the New Marche had fled hither, with
their most valuable effects, in hopes of security when the Russians
entered the Prussian territories; so that a great many who,
a little while ago, were possessed of considerable fortunes, are
now reduced to beggary. On the roads nothing was to be seen
but misery, and nothing to be heard but such cries and lamentations
as were enough to move even the stones. No one knew
where to get a morsel of bread, nor what to do for farther subsistence.
The fire was so furious that the cannon in the store
and artillery houses were all melted. The loaded bombs and
cartridges for cannon and muskets, with a large quantity of gunpowder,
went off at once with a most horrible explosion. The
fury of the enemy fell almost entirely upon the inhabitants.
They did not begin to batter the fortifications, except with a few
shot, till the 17th, after the rest was all destroyed.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">The</span> battle of Zorndorf was the most bloody of the Seven
Years’ War. It is often considered the most furious battle which
was ever fought. While Frederick was engaged in this arduous
campaign in the extreme north, driving the Russians from the
Prussian territory, an Austrian army, ninety thousand strong,
under General Daun, was endeavoring to reconquer Saxony.
The Prussian king had left his brother Henry in defense of the
province, with a small force garrisoned in the city of Dresden.</p>

<p>On the 2d of September, 1758, Frederick, advancing from the
smouldering ruins of Cüstrin, pushed forward his columns by
forced marches for the rescue of his brother, who was nearly surrounded
by vastly outnumbering foes. While upon this rapid
march an Austrian courier was captured, with the following dispatch,
which he was bearing from General Daun to General Fermor,
whose army of Russians had just been so terribly beaten
by Frederick upon the field of Zorndorf, but of which fact the
Austrian general had not yet been apprised:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Your excellency does not know that wily enemy, the King
of Prussia, as well as I do. By no means get into a battle with
him. Cautiously manœuvre about. Detain him there till I
have got my stroke in Saxony done. Don’t try fighting him.</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">Daun.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Frederick, with grim humor characteristic of him, sent back
the courier with the following response, as if from the Russian
general, signed Fermor, but in the king’s handwriting:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Your excellency was right to warn me against a cunning enemy
whom you know better than I. Here have I tried fighting
him, and have got beaten. Your unfortunate</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Fermor</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

    <div class="caption">CAMPAIGN OF HOCHKIRCH.</div></div>

<p>On the 12th of September Frederick dined with his brother
Henry in Dresden. General Daun, as soon as he heard of the
approach of the foe whom he so much dreaded, rapidly retreated
eastward to Stolpen, on the road to Bautzen. Here he intrenched
himself in one of the strongest posts in Germany. As Frederick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
at Dresden, received his supplies from Bautzen, he was
much embarrassed in having his line of communication thus cut.
Finding all his efforts vain to provoke Daun to a battle, after
four weeks of such endeavors, he loaded his baggage trains with
supplies for nine days, and by a rapid march, brushing away in
the movement Daun’s right flank, and advancing through Bautzen,
established himself among the hills of Hochkirch. He had
thus taken position thirty miles east of General Daun’s encampment
at Stolpen, cutting off his line of supply.</p>

<p>This movement of Frederick took place on the 1st of October,
1758. On the 5th, General Daun, who stood in great dread of
the military ability of his foe, after holding a council of war,
made a stealthy march, in a dark and rainy night, a little to the
south of Frederick’s encampment, and took a strong position
about a mile east of him, at Kittlitz, near Löbau. With the utmost
diligence he reared intrenchments and palisades to guard
himself from attack by a foe whom he outnumbered more than
two to one. He thus again blocked Frederick’s direct communication
with Silesia.</p>

<p>General Daun’s army, numbering ninety thousand men, occupied
very strong positions in a line extending north and south
about five miles. On the 10th, Frederick, having obtained the
needful supplies, resolutely, rashly—but, situated as he was,
what the world deemed rashness was prudence—advanced with
but twenty-eight thousand men to assail this foe of ninety thousand
behind his intrenchments. About five miles to the north,
in the rear of the heights of Weissenberg, Frederick had a reserve
of ten or twelve thousand men under General Retzow.</p>

<p>As the Prussian king brought up his little army to within a
mile of the lines of General Daun, and ordered the troops to take
position there, his boldest generals were appalled. It seemed to
be courting sure and utter destruction. The king’s favorite adjutant
general, Marwitz, ventured to remonstrate against so fearful
a risk. He was immediately ordered under arrest. The line
was formed while the Austrian cannon were playing incessantly
upon it. General Retzow, who for some cause had failed to
seize the heights of Stromberg, was also placed under arrest.
Thus the king taught all that he would be obeyed implicitly
and without questioning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
General Keith, as he looked upon the long and compact lines
of General Daun, and saw how apparently easy it would be for
him, from his commanding position, to annihilate the Prussian
army, said to the king, sadly,</p>

<p>“If the Austrians do not attack us here they deserve to be
hanged.”</p>

<p>The king coolly replied, “We must hope that they are more
afraid of us than even of the gallows.”</p>

<p>On Friday, the 13th of October, the two hostile armies, separated
merely by a brook and a ravine, were within half a mile
of each other. Daun had manifested great timidity in not venturing
from behind his intrenchments to attack the little band
of Prussians. Frederick, emboldened by this cowardice on the
part of his opponent, made his arrangements to assail the Austrians
in a secret attack before the dawn of the morning of Saturday,
the 14th. In the mean time, Daun, probably a little
ashamed of being held at bay by so small a force, formed his
plan to surround and destroy the whole Prussian army. It is
generally conceded by military critics that the plan was admirably
conceived, and would have been triumphantly executed but
for the singular ability displayed by Frederick.</p>

<p>General Daun directed the energies of his ninety thousand
troops upon the right wing of the Prussians, which could not
number more than twenty thousand men. As soon as it was
dark on Friday night, the 13th, he sent thirty thousand men, under
guides familiar with every rod of the country, by a circuitous
route, south of the Prussian lines, through forest roads, to
take position on the west of the Prussian right wing, just in its
rear. General Daun himself accompanied this band of picked
men.</p>

<p>At three o’clock of a dark and misty morning, the Austrians
from the west, the south, and the east rushed upon the sleeping
Prussians. At the same time, an attack was made upon the left
wing of the Prussians, which was a feint to bewilder them, and
to prevent re-enforcements from being sent to the right wing.
For five hours there was a scene of tumult, confusion, and horror
which can neither be described nor imagined. The morning
was dark, the fog dense, and the Prussians, though ever on the
alert, were taken by surprise. No one in the army of Frederick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
thought either of running or of surrendering. It was a hand-to-hand
fight, with bayonets, and sabres, and butts of muskets.
Marshal Keith, after receiving two bullet-wounds which he did
not regard, was shot through the heart.</p>

<p>As the morning dawned it was manifest to Frederick that the
battle was lost, and that there was no salvation for the remnant
of his troops but in a precipitate retreat. He had lost a hundred
pieces of cannon, nearly all of his tents and camp furniture,
and over eight thousand of his brave troops were either dead or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
captive. Though the Austrians had lost about the same number
of men, they had still over eighty thousand left.</p>

<p>With wonderful skill, Frederick conducted his retreat about
four miles to the northwest. Here he took a strong position at
Doberschütz, and again bade defiance to the Austrians. Slowly,
proudly, and in perfect order he retired, as if merely shifting his
ground. His cavalry was drawn up as on parade, protecting his
baggage-wagons as they defiled through the pass of Drehsa.
The Austrians gazed quietly upon the movement, not venturing
to renew the attack by daylight upon such desperate men.</p>

<p>Though, as we may see from Frederick’s private correspondence,
he suffered terribly in these hours of adversity and peril,
he assumed in public a tranquil and even a jocose air. Meeting
De Catt upon the evening of that dreadful day, he approached
him, smiling, and with theatric voice and gesture declaimed a
passage from Racine, the purport of which was, “Well, here you
see me not a conqueror, but vanquished.”</p>

<p>While on the retreat, one of his aids approached him, and the
king, with a smile, said, “Daun has played me a slippery trick
to-day.”</p>

<p>“I have seen it,” was the reply; “but it is only a scratch,
which your majesty will soon heal again.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” inquired the king.</p>

<p>“Not only I,” the aid replied, “but the whole army, firmly believe
it of your majesty.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right,” responded the king. “We will manage
Daun. What I lament is the number of brave men who
have died this morning.”</p>

<p>The next day he remarked, “Daun has let us out of checkmate.
The game is not lost yet. We will rest ourselves here
for a few days, then we will go to Silesia and deliver Neisse.
But where are all your guns?” he said, playfully, to an artilleryman,
who stood, vacant, on parade.</p>

<p>“Your majesty,” replied the gunner, “the devil stole them all
last night.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the king, gayly, “we must have them back from
him again.”</p>

<p>The fourth day after this dreadful defeat the king received
the tidings of the death of Wilhelmina. It was apparently the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
heaviest blow he had ever encountered. The anguish which her
death caused him he did not attempt to conceal. In a business
letter to Prince Henry we find this burst of feeling:</p>

<p>“Great God! my sister of Baireuth, my noble Wilhelmina,
dead; died in the very hours while we were fighting here.”</p>

<p>The king, in a letter to Voltaire upon this occasion, writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It will have been easy for you to conceive my grief when
you reflect upon the loss I have had. There are some misfortunes
which are reparable by constancy and courage, but there
are others against which all the firmness with which one can arm
one’s self, and all the reasonings of philosophers, are only vain
and useless attempts at consolation.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> Of the latter kind is the
one with which my unhappy fate overwhelms me, at a moment
the most embarrassing and the most anxious of my whole life. I
have not been so sick as you have heard. My only complaints
are colics, sometimes hemorrhoidal, and sometimes nephritic.</p>

<p>“If it had depended upon me, I would willingly have devoted
myself to that death which those maladies sooner or later bring
upon one, in order to save and prolong the life of her whose eyes
are now closed. I beseech you never to forget her. Collect all
your powers to raise a monument to her honor. You need only
do her justice. Without any way abandoning the truth, she will
afford you an ample and beautiful subject. I wish you more repose
and happiness than falls to my lot.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Frederick.</span>”<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The court at Vienna received with transports of joy the tidings
of the victory of Hochkirch. The pope was greatly elated.
He regarded the battle as one between the Catholic and Protestant
powers. The holy father, Clement XIII., sent a letter of
congratulation to Marshal Daun, together with a sword and hat,
both blessed by his holiness. The occurrence excited the derision
of Frederick, who was afterward accustomed to designate
his opponent as “the blessed general with the papal hat.” Frederick
remained at Doberschütz ten days. During this time his
brother Henry joined him from Dresden with six thousand foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
and horse. This raised his force to a little above thirty thousand
men. General Finck was left in command of the few Prussian
troops who remained for the defense of the capital of Saxony.</p>

<p>The Austrian general, flushed with victory, at the head of
eighty thousand troops, encamped in strong positions a few miles
east of Frederick, on the road to Neisse, in Silesia. Narrowly he
watched the movements of his Prussian majesty, but he did not
venture to molest him. Neisse was at that time closely besieged
by the Austrians. It would inevitably soon fall into their hands
unless Frederick could march to its succor. The great strategic
object of the Austrian commander was so to block up the road
as to prevent the advance of the Prussian troops. Frederick, despising
the inactivity of his cautious foe, said to his brother,</p>

<p>“Daun has thrown up his cards, so the game is not yet lost.
Let us repose ourselves for some days, and then go to the assistance
of Neisse.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>In the mean while, Marshal Daun was so confident that Frederick,
with but thirty thousand men, could not drive him from
his intrenchments, guarded by eighty thousand veteran troops,
that he wrote to General Harsch, who was conducting the siege
of Neisse,</p>

<p>“Go on quietly with your siege. I have the king within my
grasp. He is cut off from Silesia except by attacking me. If he
does that, I hope to give you a good account of what happens.”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>On Tuesday evening, October 24, 1758, Frederick, in a rapid
and secret march, protected by darkness, pushed his whole army
around the right wing of the Austrian encampment, and took a
very strong position at Reichenbach, in the rear of Marshal Daun,
and on the road to Neisse. The Austrian general, astonished at
this bold and successful manœuvre, now found that the march
of Frederick to Neisse could by no possibility be prevented except
by attacking him on his own chosen ground. This he did
not dare to do. He therefore resolved to make a rush with his
whole army to the west for the capture of Dresden. Frederick,
in the mean time, by forced marches, was pressing forward to the
east for the relief of Neisse. Thus the two armies were flying
from each other in opposite directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
When the Austrian general conducting the siege at Neisse
heard of the rapid approach of Frederick, he, in consternation,
blew up many of his works, abandoned several guns, and, on the
6th of November, fled with his army over the hills to the south,
to take shelter in Austria. Frederick triumphantly entered
Neisse, and, having driven the Austrians from every outpost,
commenced, with a recruited army, his return march to Dresden.
The more slow-footed Daun did not reach Dresden till the 8th
of the month. The city, outside of the walls, was crowded with
the dwellings of the more respectable citizens, and the beautiful
mansions of the wealthy. The King of Poland was Elector of
Saxony, and was in alliance with Austria. For the Austrian
commander to pursue any measure which should lead to the destruction,
in whole or in part, of this beautiful capital, would inflict
a terrible blow upon the subjects of the ally of Austria.</p>

<p>As General Daun approached the city, the Prussian general
who had been left in command of the small garrison there sent
word to him that, should he menace Dresden with his forces, the
Prussian commander would be under the necessity of setting fire
to the suburbs, as a measure of self-defense. Daun, expostulating
vehemently against so cruel an act, regardless of the menace, approached
the city on the 9th of November, and at midnight commenced
rearing his batteries for the bombardment. In the mean
time the Prussian general had filled many of the largest houses
with combustibles. As the clock struck three in the morning
the torch was applied. The unhappy inhabitants had but three
hours’ notice that their houses were to be surrendered to destruction.
Instantly the flames burst forth with terrific fury in all
directions. Sir Andrew Mitchel, who witnessed the conflagration,
writes:</p>

<p>“The whole suburb seemed on a blaze. Nay, you would have
said the whole town was environed in flames. I will not describe
to your lordship the horror, the terror, the confusion of
this night; the wretched inhabitants running with their furniture
toward the great garden. All Dresden, in appearance, girt
with flames, ruin, and smoke.”</p>

<p>The army of General Daun, with its re-enforcements, amounted
to one hundred thousand men. The Prussian garrison in the
city numbered but ten thousand. The Prussian officer then in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
command, General Schmettau, emboldened by the approach of
Frederick, repelled all proposals for capitulation.</p>

<p>“I will defend myself,” he said, “by the known rules of war
and honor to the last possible moment.”</p>

<p>On the 15th of November Frederick arrived at Lauban, within
a hundred miles of Dresden. General Daun immediately
raised the siege and retired into Bohemia. Frederick marched
triumphantly into the city. Thus, as the extraordinary result of
the defeat at Hochkirch, Frederick, by the exhibition of military
ability which astonished Europe, regained Neisse, retained Dresden,
and swept both Silesia and Saxony entirely free of his foes.
Frederick remained in Dresden about a month. He then retired
to Breslau, in Silesia, for winter quarters. The winter was a very
sad one to him. Private griefs and public calamities weighed
heavily upon his heart.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> Though during the year he had destroyed
a hundred thousand of his enemies, he had lost thirty
thousand of his own brave little band. It was almost impossible,
by any energies of conscription, to replace this waste of war.
His treasury was exhausted. Though he wrenched from the
wretched Saxons every dollar which military rapacity and violence
could extort from them, still they were so impoverished by
the long and desolating struggle that but little money could be
found in the almost empty purses of a beggared people. Another
campaign was soon to open, in which the allies, with almost
unlimited resources of men and treasure, would again come crowding
upon him in all directions in overpowering numbers.</p>

<p>In a letter to his friend Lord Marischal, dated Dresden, November
23, 1758, just after the retreat of Daun into Bohemia
from Saxony, Frederick writes sadly,</p>

<p>“There is nothing left for us, my dear lord, but to mingle and
blend our weeping for the losses we have had. If my head were
a fountain of tears, it would not suffice for the grief I feel.</p>

<p>“Our campaign is over. And there is nothing come of it on
the one side or the other but the loss of a great many worthy
people, the misery of a great many poor soldiers crippled forever,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
the ruin of some provinces, and the ravage, pillage, and conflagration
of some flourishing towns. These are exploits which
make humanity suffer; sad fruits of the wickedness and ambition
of certain people in power, who sacrifice every thing to their
unbridled passions. I wish you, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon cher milord</i>, nothing that
has the least resemblance to my destiny, and every thing that is
wanting to it.”</p>

<p>Thus ended in clouds, darkness, and woe the third campaign
of the Seven Years’ War. The winter was employed by both
parties in preparing for a renewal of the struggle. As the spring
opened the allies had in the field such a military array as Europe
had never seen before. Three hundred thousand men extended
in a cordon of posts from the Giant Mountains, near the
borders of Silesia, to the ocean. In the north, also, Russia had
accumulated her vast armies for vigorous co-operation with the
southern troops. All the leading Continental powers—France,
Austria, Russia, Sweden, and the states of the German Empire—were
combined against Prussia. England alone was the inefficient
ally of Frederick. Small sums of money were loaned him
from the British cabinet; and the court of St. James, hostile in
heart to the Prussian king, co-operated with him only so far as
was deemed essential for the promotion of British interests.</p>

<p>Perhaps never before was a monarch surrounded by difficulties
so great. The energy and sagacity Frederick displayed have
never been surpassed, if ever equaled.</p>

<p>It was a dreary winter to Frederick in Breslau. Sad, silent,
and often despairing, he was ever inflexibly resolved to struggle
till the last possible moment, and, if need be, to bury himself beneath
the ruins of his kingdom. All his tireless energies he devoted
to the Herculean work before him. No longer did he affect
gayety or seek recreations. Secluded, solitary, sombre, he
took counsel of no one. In the possession of absolute power, he
issued his commands as with the authority of a god.</p>

<p>Frederick made several unavailing efforts during the winter
to secure peace. He was weary of a war which threatened his utter
destruction. The French were also weary of a struggle in
which they encountered but losses and disgraces. England had
but little to hope for from the conflict, and would gladly see the
exhaustive struggle brought to a close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
“Many men in all nations long for peace. But there are three
women at the top of the world who do not. Their wrath, various
in quality, is great in quantity, and disasters do the reverse
of appeasing it.”<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>Of these three women who then held the destinies of Europe
in their hands, one only, Maria Theresa, in the estimation of the
public, had good cause for war. Frederick was undeniably a
highway robber, seeking to plunder her. She was heroically,
nobly struggling in self-defense. The guilty Duchess of Pompadour,
who, having the entire control of the infamous king, Louis
XV., was virtually the Empress of France, stung by an insult
from Frederick, did not hesitate to deluge Europe in blood, that
she might take the vengeance of a “woman scorned” upon her
foe. Catharine II., Empress of Russia, who in moral pollution
rivaled the most profligate of kings—whom Carlyle satirizes as
“a kind of she Louis XIV.”—also stung by one of Frederick’s
witty and bitter epigrams, was mainly impelled by personal
pique to push forth her armies into the bloody field.</p>

<p>The impartial student of history must admit that, were the
government of the world taken from the hands of men, and
placed in the hands of women, still the anticipated millennium
of righteousness and peace might be far distant.</p>

<p>In the following letter, which Frederick wrote at this time
to his friend D’Argens, he unbosoms his sorrows with unusual
frankness. The letter was dated Breslau, March 1, 1759:</p>

<p>“I have passed my winter like a Carthusian monk. I dine
alone. I spend my life in reading and writing, and I do not sup.
When one is sad, it becomes, at last, too burdensome to hide one’s
grief continually. It is better to give way to it than to carry
one’s gloom into society. Nothing solaces me but the vigorous
application required in steady and continuous labor. This distraction
does force one to put away painful ideas while it lasts.
But alas! no sooner is the work done than these fatal companions
present themselves again, as if livelier than ever. Maupertuis
was right; the sum of evil does certainly surpass that of
good. But to me it is all one. I have almost nothing more to
lose; and my few remaining days—what matters it much of
what complexion they be?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
During this dismal winter of incessant and almost despairing
labor the indefatigable king wrote several striking treatises on
military affairs. It is manifest that serious thoughts at times
occupied his mind. He doubtless reflected that if there were a
God who took any cognizance of human affairs, there must be
somewhere responsibility to Him for the woes with which these
wars were desolating humanity. To the surprise of De Catt, the
king presented him one evening with a sermon upon “The Last
Judgment,” from his own pen. He also put upon paper his
thoughts “On the new kind of tactics necessary with the Austrians
and their allies.” He seems himself to have been surprised
that he had been able so long to resist such overpowering
numbers. In allusion to the allies he writes:</p>

<p>“To whose continual sluggishness and strange want of concert—to
whose incoherency of movements, languor of execution,
and other enormous faults, we have owed, with some excuse for
our own faults, our escape from destruction hitherto.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">By</span> the most extraordinary exertions, which must have almost
depopulated his realms of all the young men and those of middle
age, Frederick succeeded in so filling up his depleted ranks
as to have in the opening spring of 1759 two hundred thousand
men in field and garrison. Indeed, regardless of all the laws of
nations, he often compelled the soldiers and other men of conquered
provinces to enlist in his armies. How he, in his poverty,
obtained the pecuniary resources requisite to the carrying on
of such a war, is to the present day a matter of amazement.</p>

<p>England furnished him with a subsidy of about four million
dollars. He immediately melted this coin, gold and silver, and
adulterated it with about half copper, thus converting his four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
millions into nominally eight millions. But a few weeks of such
operations as he was engaged in would swallow up all this.
The merciless conscription, grasping nearly every able-bodied
man, destroyed nearly all the arts of industry. The Prussian
realms, thus impoverished by war’s ravages and taxation, could
furnish the king with very meagre supplies. When the king
invaded any portion of the territory of the allies, he wrenched
from the beggared people every piece of money which violence
or terror could extort. Wealthy merchants were thrown into
prison, and fed upon bread and water until they yielded. The
most terrible severities were practiced to extort contributions
from towns which had been stripped and stripped again. Still
violence could wrench but little from the skinny hand of beggary.
These provinces, swept by war’s surges year after year,
were in the most deplorable state of destitution and misery.</p>

<p>From the schedule which Frederick has given of his resources,
it seems impossible that he could have raised more than about
fifteen million dollars annually, even counting his adulterated
coin at the full value. How, with this sum, he could have successfully
confronted all combined Europe, is a mystery which
has never yet been solved. It was the great object of both parties
in this terrible conflict to destroy every thing in the enemy’s
country which could by any possibility add to military power.
All the claims of humanity were ignored. The starvation of
hundreds of thousands of peasants—men, women, and children—was
a matter not to be taken into consideration. The French
minister, in Paris, wrote to Marshal De Contades on the 5th of
October, 1758,</p>

<p>“You must make a desert of Westphalia. With regard to the
countries of Lippe and Padeborn, as these are very fertile provinces,
you must take great care to destroy every thing in them
without exception.”</p>

<p>Early in the spring of 1759 the Prussian king had gathered
the main body of his troops in fortresses and strong positions in
the vicinity of Landshut, on the southwestern frontier of Silesia.
The enemy, under General Daun, faced him, in longer and denser
lines, equally well intrenched. At the same time, powerful bands
of the allies were in various parts of Europe, menacing the domains
of Frederick at every vulnerable point. The allies dreaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
the prowess of their foe. Frederick was compelled to caution
by the exhaustless numbers of his opponents. Thus for many
weeks neither party entered upon any decisive action. There
was, however, an almost incessant series of fierce and bloody
skirmishes.</p>

<p>The ability which Frederick displayed in striking his enemies
where they would most keenly feel the infliction, and in warding
off the blows they attempted in return, excited then the surprise
of Europe, and has continued to elicit the astonishment of
posterity. It would but weary the reader to attempt a description
of these conflicts at the outposts, terrible as they often were.</p>

<p>During this time, in May, the king wrote a very bitter and satirical
ode against Louis XV.—“the plaything of the Pompadour,”
“polluted with his amours,” “and disgracefully surrendering
the government of his realms to chance.” The ode he sent
to Voltaire. The unprincipled poet, apprehending that the ode
might come to light, and that he might be implicated, treacherously
sent it to the prime minister, the Duke De Choiseul, to be
shown to the king. At the same time, he wrote to Frederick
that he had burned the ode. In the account which Voltaire
himself gives of this disgraceful transaction, he writes:</p>

<p>“The packet had been opened. The king would think I was
guilty of high treason, and I should be in disgrace with Madame
De Pompadour. I was obliged, in order to prevent my ruin, to
make known to the court the character and conduct of their enemy.</p>

<p>“I knew that the Duke De Choiseul would content himself
with persuading the King of France that the King of Prussia
was an irreconcilable enemy, whom it was therefore necessary, if
possible, to annihilate.</p>

<p>“I wrote to Frederick that his ode was beautiful, but that he
had better not make it public, lest it should close all the avenues
to a reconciliation with the King of France, incense him irremediably,
and thus force him to strain every nerve in vengeance.</p>

<p>“I added that my niece had burned his ode from fear that it
should be imputed to me. He believed me and thanked me;
not, however, without some reproaches for having burned the
best verses he had ever made.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
The latter part of June, an army of a hundred thousand Russians,
having crossed the Vistula, was concentrated, under General
Soltikof, at Posen, on the River Warta, in Poland. They
were marching from the northeast to attack the Prussian forces
near Landshut in their rear. General Daun, with a still larger
force of Austrians, was confronting Frederick on the southwest.
The plan of the allies was to crush their foe between these two
armies. Frederick had lost the ablest of his generals. The
young men who were filling their places were untried.</p>

<p>The Russians, triumphantly advancing, entered Silesia, and
reached Crossen, on the Oder, within a hundred miles of Frederick’s
encampment.</p>

<p>Some trifling unavailing efforts had been made for peace. In
reply to a letter from Voltaire, alluding to this subject, Frederick
wrote, under date of 2d July, 1759:</p>

<p>“Asking <em>me</em> for peace is indeed a bitter joke. It is to Louis
XV. you must address yourself, or to his Amboise in petticoats.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>
But these people have their heads filled with ambitious projects.
They wish to be the sovereign arbiters of sovereigns. That is
what persons of my way of thinking will by no means put up
with. I like peace as much as you could wish, but I want it
good, solid, and honorable. Socrates or Plato would have
thought as I do on this subject had they found themselves in
the accursed position which is mine in the world.</p>

<p>“Think you there is any pleasure in living this dog’s life, in
seeing and causing the butchery of people you know nothing of,
in losing daily those you do know and love, in seeing perpetually
your reputation exposed to the caprices of chance, passing
year after year in disquietudes and apprehensions, in risking
without end your life and your fortune?</p>

<p>“I know right well the value of tranquillity, the sweets of society,
the charms of life. I love to be happy as much as any one
whatever. But, much as I desire these blessings, I will not purchase
them by baseness and infamies. Philosophy enjoins us to
do our duty faithfully, to serve our country at the price of our
blood, of our repose, and of every sacrifice which can be required
of us.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p>Soon after this Frederick dispatched a young and impetuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
officer, General Wedell, invested with dictatorial powers, at the
head of twenty-six thousand men, to attack the Russian army,
at every hazard, and arrest its march. The heroic little band of
Prussians met the Russians at Züllichau. One of General Wedell’s
officers remonstrated against the attack.</p>

<p>“The risk is too great,” said he; “Soltikof has seventy thousand
men, and no end of artillery. We have but twenty-six
thousand, and know not that we can bring a single gun to where
Soltikof is.”</p>

<p>Still the order was given for the assault. The Prussians
plunged into the dense ranks of their foes, regardless of being
outnumbered nearly three to one. A terrible battle was fought.
General Wedell was overpowered and beaten. He retreated
across the Oder, having lost six thousand men in killed, wounded,
and prisoners. The victorious Russians did not pursue him.
They marched down the river to Frankfort, where they effected
a junction with other troops, giving them an effective force of
ninety-six thousand fighting men.</p>

<p>Frederick received the disastrous news on the 24th of July,
the day after the calamity. In the exercise of an unusual spirit
of forbearance, he sent word to the defeated general, “It is not
your fault; I dreaded something of the kind.” The king’s brother
Henry was in command of a few thousand men near Bautzen,
in Saxony. Frederick wrote to him to forward his troops immediately,
so as to form a union with the retreating army under
Wedell. Henry himself was to repair to the vicinity of Landshut,
and take command of the army which was to be left in that
vicinity confronting General Daun. The king took about thirty
thousand picked troops, and hurried to the north to gather up
by the way the troops of Henry and of Wedell, and with that
combined force of forty-eight thousand men make a new attack
upon the ninety-six thousand Russians.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>It was an act of desperation. The king fully appreciated its
peril. But the time had long since passed when he could rely
upon the ordinary measures of prudence. In despair was his
only hope.</p>

<p>On the 29th of July the king joined his brother Henry at Sagan,
on the Bober, about sixty miles above or south of Frankfort.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
The marches which had been effected by the king and his brother
were the most rapid which had <em>then</em> ever been heard of.
Greatly perplexed by the inexplicable movements of the Russians,
the king pressed on till he effected a junction with the remnant
of Wedell’s defeated army, near Müllrose, within twelve
miles of Frankfort. He reached this place on the 3d of August.
To Count Finckenstein he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I am just arrived here after cruel and frightful marchings.
There is nothing desperate in all that. I believe the noise and
disquietude this hurly-burly has caused will be the worst of it.
Show this letter to every body, that it may be known that the
state is not undefended. I have made about one thousand prisoners
from Haddick.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> All his meal-wagons have been taken.
Finck,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> I believe, will keep an eye on him. This is all I can say.
To-morrow I march to within two leagues of Frankfort. Katte
must instantly send me two hundred tons of meal and one hundred
bakers. I am very tired. For six nights I have not closed
an eye. Farewell.</p>

<p class="sigright">
F.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>The Russians, with empty meal-wagons and starving soldiers,
had taken possession of Frankfort-on-the-Oder on the 29th of
July. The city contained twelve thousand inhabitants. The
ransom which the Russian general demanded to save the city
from pillage by the Cossacks was four hundred and fifty thousand
dollars. Pillage by the Cossacks! No imagination can
conceive the horrors of such an event. Nearly one hundred
thousand men, frenzied with intoxication, brutal in their habits,
restrained by no law, would inflict every outrage which fiends
could conceive of. Well might fathers and mothers, sons and
daughters, turn pale and feel the blood curdle in their veins at
the thought. Four hundred and fifty thousand dollars ransom!
That was nearly forty dollars for each individual, man, woman,
and child! Compliance with the demand was impossible.
Frankfort, in its impoverishment, could by no possibility raise
a tenth part of the sum. Dreadful was the consternation. There
was no relenting; the money or the pillage!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
With the utmost exertions, inspired by terror, thirty thousand
dollars were at length raised. The Russian general, Soltikof,
naturally a humane man, seeing, at the close of a week of frantic
exertions on the part of the magistrates of Frankfort, the impossibility
of extorting the required sum, took the thirty thousand
dollars, and kept his barbarian hordes encamped outside the gates.</p>

    <div class="caption">FREDERICK CROSSING THE ODER.</div></div>

<p>Frankfort is on the west side of the Oder. The Russian army
was encamped on the eastern side of the river. The force collected
there consisted of about seventy-eight thousand Russians
and eighteen thousand Austrians. Frederick had, by great exertions,
gathered fifty thousand troops to attack them. He was
approaching Frankfort from the southwest. In a secret midnight
march he crossed the river by bridges of boats some miles
north of the city, near Cüstrin. At four o’clock in the morning
of the 11th of August his troops had all accomplished the passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
of the stream, and, to the surprise of the Russians, were
marching down upon them from the north.</p>

<p>Vastly superior as was the Russian army in numbers, General
Soltikof did not venture to advance to attack his terrible foe.
He had selected a very strong position on a range of eminences
about one hundred feet high, running for several miles in an easterly
direction from the river. Upon this ridge, which was called
“the Heights of Kunersdorf,” the Russian general had intrenched
himself with the utmost care. The surrounding country was
full of bogs, and sluggish streams, and a scraggy growth of tough
and thorny bushes, almost impenetrable.</p>

<p>Had the Prussian troops been placed on those heights, behind
that formidable array of ramparts, and palisades, and abatis, they
could with ease have repelled the assaults of three or four times
their number. But now they were to undertake the desperate
enterprise of advancing to the assault under the greatest disadvantages,
with one to attack where there were two to defend.
Frederick rapidly advanced from crossing the stream, and the
same evening, Saturday, August 11th, encamped at Bischofsee, at
the distance of about two miles to the northeast of the intrenched
camp of his foes. The king, accompanied by a small escort, rode
forward to the knolls of Trettin, and anxiously surveyed with
his glass the fearful array of his foes in their long, compact, well-defended
lines, arranged in an elongated irregular parallelogram.</p>

<p>About three o’clock the next morning, Sunday, August 12th,
Frederick’s army, in two columns, was again in motion. By a
slightly circuitous march through the dense forest the king placed
his troops in position to approach from the southeast, so as to
attack the left flank of the enemy, being the northern extremity
of the parallelogram.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to describe the battle which ensued—so
bloody, so disastrous to the Prussians. It was, like all other desperate
battles, a scene of inconceivable confusion, tumult, and
horror. At eight o’clock in the morning, General Finck (who
was in command of the right wing of the Prussians) was in position
to move upon the extreme northern point of attack. It
was not until half past eleven that Frederick, in command of the
main body of the army, was ready to make a co-operative assault
from the east. At the point of attack the Russians had seventy-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>two
cannons in battery. The Prussians opened upon them with
sixty guns. Templeton describes the cannonade as the loudest
which he had yet ever heard.</p>

<p>After half an hour of rapid and terrific fire, the Prussian troops
were ordered to advance and storm the works of the foe on the
Mühlberg Hill. Like wolves in the chase, these men of iron
nerves rushed forward through torrents of grape-shot and musket-shot,
which covered their path with the dead. In ten minutes
they were in possession of the hill-top, with all its batteries.
The left wing of the Russian army was thrown into a maelstrom
whirl of disorder and destruction. One hundred and eighty of
the artillery pieces of the enemy fell into the hands of the victors.</p>

<p>Frederick was overjoyed. He regarded the day as his own,
and the Russian army as at his mercy. He sent a dispatch to
anxious Berlin, but sixty miles distant: “The Russians are beaten.
Rejoice with me.” It was one of the hottest of August
days, without a breath of wind. Nearly every soldier of the
Prussian army had been brought into action against the left wing
only of the foe. After a long march and an exhausting fight,
they were perishing with thirst. For twelve hours many of them
had been without water. Panting with heat, thirst, and exhaustion,
they were scarcely capable of any farther efforts.</p>

<p>Just then eighteen thousand fresh Russian troops advanced
upon them in solid phalanx from their centre and their right
wing. It was nearly three o’clock in the afternoon. The fugitive
Russians were rallied. With new impetuosity the re-enforced
band hurled itself upon the Prussians. They speedily regained
their hundred and eighty guns, and opened upon the
ranks of Frederick such torrents of grape-shot as no flesh and
blood could endure. Huge gaps were torn through his lines.
His men recoiled, whirled round, and were driven pell-mell from
the hill.</p>

<p>Thrice Frederick in person led the charge against the advancing
foe. He had three horses shot under him. A gold snuffbox
in his pocket was flattened by a bullet. His friends entreated
him not thus to peril a life upon which every thing depended.
He was deaf to all remonstrances. It is manifest that,
in his despair, he sought a soldier’s grave.</p>

<p>On came the Russians in ever-increasing numbers. Frederick’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
heavy artillery, each piece drawn by twelve horses, could
not be brought forward through the bogs, and the entangling
woods, and over the rugged heights. Though the Prussians
fought with all the energies mortal valor could inspire, and
though the king flew from post to post of peril and of death, animating
his troops by voice and gesture, and by his own reckless
courage, it was all in vain. Hope soon died in all hearts. The
king was heard despairingly to exclaim, “Is there not one bullet
which can reach me, then?”</p>

<p>Frederick had seen many dark days before, but never one so
dark as this. In the frenzy of his exertions to retrieve the lost
battle, he cried out to his soldiers, his eyes being flooded with
tears, “Children, do not forsake me, your king, your father, in this
pinch!” The retreat became a flight. In endeavoring to cross
the little stream called the Hen-Floss, there was such crowding
and jamming at the bridges that the Prussians were compelled
to leave one hundred and sixty-five guns of various calibre behind
them. Had the Russians pursued with any vigor, scarcely
a man of the Prussian army could have escaped. But General
Soltikof stood in such fear of his opponent, who had often wrested
victory out of defeat, that he attempted no pursuit.</p>

<p>In broken bands the Prussians retreated down by the way of
Oetscher to the bridges at Göritz, where they had crossed the
Oder, and where their heavy baggage was stationed. Frederick
was among the last to quit the fatal field. As a swarm of Cossacks
approached the spot where he stood, a party of his friends
charged them fiercely, cutting to the right and left, and held
them for a moment at bay. One of Frederick’s adjutants seized
the bridle of his horse, and galloped off with the unresisting
monarch.</p>

<p>At the bridges Frederick found but three thousand men of
his late army. The huts around were filled with the wounded
and the dying, presenting an aspect of misery which, in these
hours of terrible defeat, appalled his majesty. In one of these
huts, surrounded by mutilated bodies, groans, and death, Frederick
wrote the following dispatch to his minister (Finckenstein)
at Berlin. It was dated Oetscher, August 12, 1759:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I attacked the enemy this morning about eleven. We beat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>him back to the Jews’ Church-yard, near Frankfort.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> All my
troops came into action, and have done wonders. I reassembled
them three times. At length I was myself nearly taken prisoner,
and we had to quit the field. My coat is riddled with bullets.
Two horses were killed under me.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> My misfortune is
that I am still alive. Our loss is very considerable. Of an army
of forty-eight thousand men, I have at this moment, while I write,
not more than three thousand together. I am no longer master
of my forces.</p>

<p>In Berlin you will do well to think of your safety. It is a
great calamity. I will not survive it. The consequences of this
battle will be worse than the battle itself. I have no resources
more; and, to confess the truth, I hold all for lost. I will not survive
the destruction of my country. Farewell forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
Probably the reader will infer from the above letter that the
king felt that the hour had come for him to die, and that he intended
to resort to that most consummate act of folly and cowardice—suicide.
He had always avowed this to be his intention
in the last resort. He had urged his sister Wilhelmina to imitate
his example in this respect, and not to survive the destruction
of their house. Ruin now seemed inevitable. In the battle of
Kunersdorf Frederick had lost, in killed and wounded, nineteen
thousand men, including nearly all the officers of distinction, and
also one hundred and sixty pieces of artillery. The remainder
of his army was so dispersed that it could not be rallied to present
any opposition to the foe.</p>

<p>Though General Soltikof had lost an equal number of men, he
was still at the head of nearly eighty thousand troops flushed
with victory. He could summon to his standard any desirable
re-enforcements. An unobstructed march of but sixty miles
would lead his army into the streets of Berlin. The affairs of
Frederick were indeed desperate. There was not a gleam of
hope to cheer him. In preparation for his retirement from the
army, from the throne, and from life, he that evening drew up
the following paper, placing the fragments of the army which he
was about to abandon in the hands of General Finck. By the
death of the king, the orphan and infant child of his brother Augustus
William (who had died but a few months before) would
succeed to the throne. Frederick appointed his brother Henry
generalissimo of the Prussian army.</p>

<p>This notable paper, which reflects but little credit upon the
character of Frederick, was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“General Finck gets a difficult commission. The unlucky
army which I give up to him is no longer in a condition to make
head against the Russians. Haddick will now start for Berlin,
perhaps Loudon too.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> If General Finck go after these, the Russians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
will fall on his rear. If he continue on the Oder, he gets
Haddick on his flank. However, I believe, should Loudon go
for Berlin, he might attack Loudon and beat him. This, if it
succeeded, would be a stand against misfortune, and hold matters
up. Time gained is much in these desperate circumstances.
Cöper, my secretary, will send him the news from Torgau and
Dresden. You must inform my brother<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> of every thing, whom
I have declared generalissimo of the army. To repair this bad
luck altogether is not possible. But what my brother shall command
must be done. The army swears to my nephew. This is
all the advice in these unhappy circumstances I am in a condition
to give. If I had still had resources, I would have staid by
them.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Frederick.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be perceived that this paper is slightly less despairing
than the preceding letter which he had written to Count Finckenstein.
Frederick, having written the order to General Finck,
threw himself, in utter exhaustion, upon some straw in a corner
of the hut, and fell soundly asleep. The Prussian officers, passing
by, gazed sadly through the open door upon the sleeping
monarch. A single sentinel guarded the entrance.</p>

<p>The next morning Frederick crossed the river to Reitwein, on
the western bank. Here, during the day, broken bands of his
army came in to the number of twenty-three thousand. It would
seem that a night of refreshing sleep had so far recruited the exhausted
energies of the king that he was enabled to look a little
more calmly upon the ruin which enveloped him. He that day
wrote as follows from Reitwein to General Schmettau, who was
in command of the Prussian garrison at Dresden:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“You will, perhaps, have heard of the check I have met with
from the Russian army on the 13th<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> of this month. Though at
bottom our affairs in regard to the enemy here are not desperate,
I find I shall not be able to make any detachment for your assistance.
Should the Austrians attempt any thing against Dresden,
therefore, you will see if there are means of maintaining
yourself; failing which, it will behoove you to try and obtain a
favorable capitulation—to wit, liberty to withdraw, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
whole garrison, moneys, magazines, hospital, and all that we have
at Dresden, either to Berlin or elsewhere, so as to join some corps
of my troops.</p>

<p>“As a fit of illness has come on me, which I do not think will
have dangerous results, I have, for the present, left the command
of my troops to Lieutenant General Von Finck, whose orders you
are to execute as if coming directly from myself. On this I pray
God<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> to have you in his holy and worthy keeping.</p>

<p class="sigright">
F.”
</p></blockquote>

    <div class="caption">FREDERICK ASLEEP IN THE HUT AT OETSCHER.</div></div>

<p>The consternation at Berlin, as contradictory reports of victory
and defeat reached the city, was indescribable. M. Sulzer, an
eye-witness of the scene, writes under date of Berlin, August 13th,
1759:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
“Above fifty thousand human beings were on the palace esplanade
and the streets around, swaying hither and thither in
an agony of expectation, in alternate paroxysms of joy, of terror,
and of woe. Often enough the opposite paroxysms were simultaneous
in the different groups. Men crushed down by despair
were met by men leaping into the air for very gladness.”</p>

<p>As we have mentioned, the Russian general had such a dread
of Frederick that he did not dare to pursue him. In his report
of the victory to the Czarina Charlotte, speaking of his own
heavy loss of over eighteen thousand men, he writes, “Your majesty
is aware that the King of Prussia sells his victories at a
dear rate.” To some who urged him to pursue Frederick, he replied,
“Let me gain but another such victory, and I may go to
Petersburg with the news of it myself alone, with my staff in
my hand.”</p>

<p>Frederick remained at Reitwein four days. He was very unjust
to his army, and angrily reproached his soldiers for their
defeat. It is true that, had every soldier possessed his own spirit,
his army would have conquered, or not a man would have left
the field alive. The Russians, with almost inconceivable inactivity,
retired to Lossow, ten miles south of Frankfort-on-the-Oder.
The king, having by great exertions collected thirty-two thousand
men, marched up the valley of the Spree, and placed himself
on the road between the Russians and Berlin.</p>

<p>While on this march he wrote from Madlitz, under date of
August 16th, to Marquis D’Argens, at Berlin:</p>

<p>“We have been unfortunate, my dear marquis, but not by my
fault. The victory was ours, and would even have been a complete
one, when our infantry lost patience, and at the wrong moment
abandoned the field of battle. The Russian infantry is almost
totally destroyed. Of my own wrecks, all that I have been
able to assemble amounts to thirty-two thousand men. With
these I am pushing on to throw myself across the enemy’s road,
and either perish or save the capital. This is not what you will
call a deficiency of resolution.</p>

<p>“For the event I can not answer. If I had more lives than
one, I would sacrifice them all to my country. But, if this stroke
fail, I think I am clear scores with her, and that it will be permissible
to look a little to myself. There are limits to every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
thing. I support my misfortune. My courage is not abated by
it. But I am well resolved, after this stroke, if it fail, to open an
outgate to myself, and no longer be the sport of any chance.”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<p>Four days after, in anticipation of an immediate attack from
the Russians, he again wrote to the same address, “Remain at
Berlin, or retire to Potsdam. In a little while there will come
some catastrophe. It is not fit that you suffer by it. If things
take a good turn, you can be back to Berlin. If ill luck still
pursue us, go to Hanover, or to Zelle, where you can provide for
your safety.”</p>

<p>The next day, the 21st of August, he wrote to D’Argens to
come and visit him, and bring his bed with him. “I will have
you a little chamber ready.” But the next day he wrote,</p>

<p>“Yesterday I wrote to you to come; to-day I forbid it. Daun
is marching upon Berlin. Fly these unhappy countries. This
news obliges me again to attack the Russians between here and
Frankfort. You may imagine if this is a desperate resolution.
It is the sole hope that remains to me of not being cut off from
Berlin on the one side or the other. I will give these discouraged
troops brandy, but I promise myself nothing of success.
My one consolation is that I shall die sword in hand.”</p>

<p>Just after dispatching this letter he received one from D’Argens,
to which he immediately, on the same day, returned the
following reply:</p>

<p>“Certainly I will fight. But do not flatter yourself about the
result. A happy chance alone can help us. Go, in God’s name
to Tangermünde. Wait there how destiny shall have disposed
of us. I will reconnoitre the enemy to-morrow. Next day, if
there is any thing to do, we will try it. If the enemy still holds
to the Wine Hills of Frankfort, I shall not dare to attack him.</p>

<p>“The torments of Tantalus, the pains of Prometheus, the doom
of Sisyphus, were nothing to the torments I have suffered for the
last ten days. Death is sweet in comparison with such a life.
Pity me, and believe that I still keep to myself a great many
evil things, not wishing to afflict or disquiet any body with them.
Believe me that I would not counsel you to fly these unlucky
countries if I had any ray of hope. Adieu, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon cher</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
The rumor that Daun was marching upon Berlin proved a
false alarm. On the 4th of September the king again wrote
D’Argens from his encampment at Waldau, a few leagues south
of his last position, just over the border in Saxony:</p>

<p>“I think Berlin is now in safety. You may return thither.
The barbarians are in the Lausitz. I keep by the side of them,
between them and Berlin, so that there is nothing to fear for the
capital. The imminency of danger is passed. But there will be
still many bad moments to get through before reaching the end
of the campaign. These, however, only regard myself. Never
mind these. My martyrdom will last two months yet. Then
the snows and the ices will end it.”</p>

<p>General Schmettau had in Dresden a garrison of but three
thousand seven hundred men. It will be remembered that he
would doubtless be compelled to capitulate, and to do so on the
best terms he could. But his Prussian majesty, being now a little
more hopeful, wrote to him again, urging him to hold out to
the last extremity, and informing him that he had dispatched to
his aid General Wunsch, with a re-enforcement of eight thousand
men, and General Finck with six thousand. The courier was
cut off. General Schmettau, entirely unconscious that relief was
coming, closely besieged, and threatened with the massacre of
his whole garrison should the place be taken by storm, on Tuesday
evening, the 4th of September, surrendered the city.</p>

<p>It was a sore calamity to Frederick. Had General Schmettau
held out only until the next day, which he could easily have done,
relief would have arrived, and the city would have been saved.
Frederick was in a great rage, and was not at all in the mood to
be merciful, or even just. He dismissed the unfortunate general
from his service, degraded him, and left him to die in poverty.</p>

<p>Frederick had now under his command twenty-four thousand
men. They were mostly on the road between Frankfort and
Berlin, for the protection of the capital. His brother Henry, in
the vicinity of Landshut, with his head-quarters at Schmöttseifen,
was in command of thirty-eight thousand. The Russians and
Austrians numbered one hundred and twenty thousand. There
was, however, but little cordial co-operation among the allies.
Each was accused of endeavoring to crowd the other to the front
of the battle against the terrible Frederick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
The Russians did not attempt to march upon Berlin. About
the middle of September General Soltikof gathered all his forces
in hand, and commenced a march into Silesia to effect a junction
with General Daun. Frederick followed, and, by a very rapid
march, took possession of Sagan, on the Bober, where he was in
direct communication with Henry. On the 24th of September
the king wrote to his younger brother Ferdinand, in Berlin:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“You may well suppose that, in the present posture of affairs,
I am not without cares, inquietudes, and anxieties. It is the
most frightful crisis I have had in my life. This is the moment
for dying, unless one conquer. Daun and my brother Henry
are marching side by side. It is possible enough all these armies
may assemble hereabouts, and that a general battle may decide
our fortune and the peace. Take care of your health, dear
brother.</p>

<p class="sigright">
F.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>There was much manœuvring, in which Frederick displayed
his usual skill, quite circumventing his foes. Daily he became
less despairing. On the 25th of October he wrote to Fouquet:</p>

<p>“With twenty-one thousand your beaten and maltreated servant
has hindered an army of fifty thousand from attacking him,
and has compelled them to retire to Neusatz.”</p>

<p>On the 10th of October Frederick was attacked by the gout,
and for three weeks was confined to his room. This extraordinary
man, struggling, as it were, in the jaws of destruction, beguiled
the weary hours of sickness and pain by writing a treatise
upon <cite>Charles XII. and his Military Character</cite>. On the 24th
of October, the Russian commander, quarreling with General
Daun, set out, with his whole force, for home. On the 1st of
November the king was carried in a litter to Glogau. Cold
weather having now set in, General Daun commenced a march
for Bohemia, to seek winter quarters nearer his supplies. Frederick,
his health being restored, rejoined his troops under Henry,
which were near Dresden. The withdrawal of both the Russians
and Austrians from Silesia greatly elated him. On the
15th of November he wrote to D’Argens from Maxen, a village
a little south of Dresden:</p>

<p>“Yesterday I joined the army, and Daun decamped. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
followed him thus far, and will continue it to the frontiers of
Bohemia. Our measures are so taken that he will not get out
of Saxony without considerable loss.”</p>

<p>General Finck was stationed at Maxen, with about fifteen
thousand men, to cut the communications of Daun with Bohemia.
Frederick, in his undue elation, was quite sure of inflicting terrible
blows upon Daun. He issued imperative commands to
General Finck to fight the allies regardless of their numbers.
The Prussian general did not dare to disobey this command and
withdraw from his commanding position, even when he saw himself
being surrounded with such superior forces as would almost
certainly crush him.</p>

<p>In a very triumphant mood, the king, on the 19th of November,
wrote a boastful and irreverent “Ode to Fortune,” in that
easy rhyme which he called poetry. The substance of this ode,
translated into prose, was as follows:</p>

<p>“I am a poor heretic. I have never been blessed by the holy
father. I never attend church. I worship neither God nor the
devil. Often have those shaven scoundrels, the priests, declared
that I had become extinct.</p>

<p>“But behold the caprice of Fortune. After a hundred preferences
of my rivals, she smiles upon me, and packs off the hero
of the hat and sword, whom the pope had blessed, and who had
gone on pilgrimages. He skulks out of Saxony, panting like a
dog whom the cook has flogged out of the kitchen.”</p>

<p>This ode, “an irrepressible extempore effusion,” as he termed
it, the royal poet forwarded to D’Argens. The day but one after
writing this, General Daun, having effectually surrounded General
Finck with nearly fifty thousand men of the allied troops—nearly
four to one—after a severe conflict, compelled the surrender
of his whole army. The following plan of the battle of
Maxen will show how completely Finck was encircled. General
Daun claimed that he marched back into Dresden, as prisoners
of war, eight generals, five hundred and twenty-nine officers, and
fifteen thousand privates, with all their equipments and appurtenances.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>
The next day, the 22d, Frederick wrote to D’Argens:</p>

<p>“I am so stupefied with the misfortune which has befallen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
General Finck that I can
not recover from my astonishment.
It deranges
all my measures. It cuts
me to the quick. Ill luck,
which persecutes my old
age, has followed me from
Kunersdorf to Saxony.
I will still strive what
I can. The little ode I
sent you, addressed to
<em>Fortune</em>, was written too
soon. One should not
shout victory until the battle is over. I am so crushed by these
reverses and disasters that I wish a thousand times I were dead.</p>

<p>“From day to day I grow more weary of dwelling in a body
worn out and condemned to suffer. I am writing to you in the
first moment of my grief. Astonishment, sorrow, indignation,
and scorn, all blended together, lacerate my soul. Let us get to
the end, then, of this execrable campaign. I will then write to
you what is to become of me, and we will arrange the rest. Pity
me, and make no noise about me. Bad news goes fast enough
of itself. Adieu, dear marquis.”</p>

<p>The king, as usual, was merciless to General Finck. As soon
as he returned from Austrian captivity he was tried by court-martial,
and condemned to a year’s imprisonment in the fortress
of Spandau, and was expelled from the army. He afterward retired
to Denmark, where he was kindly received.</p>

<p>General Daun, elated by this victory, relinquished the plan of
retiring to Bohemia, and decided to remain in Saxony for the
winter. Frederick had but thirty-six thousand men in Saxony.
Daun commanded seventy-two thousand.</p>

<p>The Elbe was now frozen. The storms of winter covered the
icy fields with snow. Daun retired to Dresden. Frederick established
himself in the little town of Freiberg, about thirty
miles southwest from Dresden. His troops were in cantonments
in the adjoining villages. Here he took up his abode in a humble
cottage. Thus terminated the fourth campaign of the Seven
Years’ War.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">It</span> was early in January, 1760, that the two hostile armies
went into winter quarters. General Daun, with his seventy-two
thousand triumphant troops, held Dresden. He encamped his
army in an arc of a circle, bending toward the southwest from
the city, and occupying a line about thirty miles in extent.
Frederick, with thirty-two thousand troops depressed by defeat,
defiantly faced his foe in a concave arc concentric to that of
Daun. The two antagonistic encampments were almost within
cannon-shot of each other.</p>

<p>Never were the prospects of Frederick more gloomy. He had
taken up his residence for the winter in a very humble cottage
near the hamlet of Freiberg. He must have been very unhappy.
Scenes of suffering were every where around him. It was terribly
cold. His troops were poorly clothed, and fed, and housed.</p>

<p>“It was one of the grimmest camps in nature; the canvas
roofs grown mere ice-plates, the tents mere sanctuaries of frost.
Never did poor young Archenholtz see such industry in dragging
wood-fuel, such boiling of biscuits in broken ice, such crowding
round the embers to roast one side of you while the other
was freezing. But Daun’s people, on the opposite side of the
Plauen Dell, did the like. Their tents also were left standing
in the frozen state, guarded by alternating battalions no better
off than their Prussian neighbors.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p>Thus affairs continued through the winter. There were two
frostbitten armies facing each other on the bleak plains. With
apparently not much to be gained in presenting this front of defiance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
each party breasted the storms and the freezing gales,
alike refusing to yield one inch of ground.</p>

    <div class="caption">THE WINTER CAMP.</div></div>

<p>During the previous summer, the philosopher Maupertuis, after
weary wanderings in the languor of consumption, and in great
dejection of spirits, had been stricken by convulsions while in
his carriage at Basel. He had lost favor with the king, and was
poor, friendless, and dying. His latter years had been imbittered
by the venomous assaults of Voltaire.</p>

<p>While in health and prosperity, quaffing the wines of Frederick,
he was an avowed infidel, and eagerly joined the ribald companions
of the king in denouncing all religion as the fanaticism
of weak minds. But in these hours of pain, of loneliness, and
of approaching death he could find no consolation in the teachings
of philosophy. He sent for two Christian ministers to visit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
him daily, and daily had the Bible read to him. It was a death-bed
repentance. Bitterly he deplored a wasted life. Sincerely
he seemed to embrace the doctrines of Christianity.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> He died,
after a lingering sickness, far from home and friends, on the 27th
of July, 1759.</p>

<p>Voltaire made himself very merry over the dying scene of
Maupertuis. There was never another man who could throw so
much poison into a sneer as Voltaire. It is probable that the
conversion of Maupertuis somewhat troubled his conscience as
the unhappy scorner looked forward to his own dying hour,
which could not be far distant. He never alluded to Maupertuis
without indulging in a strain of bitter mockery in view of
his death as a penitent. Even the king, unbeliever as he was in
religion or in the existence of a God, was disgusted with the malignity
displayed by Voltaire. In reply to one of Voltaire’s envenomed
assaults the king wrote:</p>

<p>“You speak of Maupertuis. Do not trouble the ashes of the
dead. Let the grave, at least, put an end to your unjust hatreds.
Reflect that even kings make peace after long battling. Can
not you ever make it? I think you would be capable, like Orpheus,
of descending to hell, not to soften Pluto, and bring back
your beautiful Emilie, but to pursue into that abode of woe an
enemy whom your wrath has only too much persecuted in this
world. For shame!”<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p>Soon after Frederick wrote to Voltaire upon this subject again,
still more severely, but in verse. The following is almost a literal
translation of this poetic epistle:</p>

<p>“Leave the cold ashes of Maupertuis in peace. He was noble
and faithful. He pardoned you that vile libel of Doctor Akakia
which your criminal fury scribbled against him. And what return
are you making? Shame on such delirious ravings as those
of Voltaire! Shall this grand genius, whom I have admired, soil
himself with calumny, and be ferocious on the dead? Shall he,
like a vile raven, pounce upon the sepulchre, and make prey
upon its corpses?”</p>

<p>The friendship of these two remarkable men must have been
of a singular character. Voltaire thus maliciously wrote of the
king:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
“He is as potent and as malignant as the devil. He is also
as unhappy, not knowing friendship.”</p>

<p>Voltaire had, as a pet, a very vicious ape, treacherous, spiteful,
who pelted passers-by with stones, and, when provoked, would
bite terribly. The name of this hateful beast was Luc. Voltaire
gave his friend Frederick the nickname of Luc. He corresponded
freely with the enemies of his Prussian majesty. A few
extracts will reveal the character of the friendship of the philosopher.
Some days after the battle of Kunersdorf Voltaire wrote
to D’Argental:</p>

<p>“I do not love Luc; far from it. I never will pardon him his
infamous procedure with my niece,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> nor the face he has to write
me flattering things twice a month without having ever repaired
his wrongs. I desire much his entire humiliation, the chastisement
of the sinner; whether his eternal damnation I do not
quite know.”</p>

<p>Again he wrote, a few months after, to the Duke of Choiseul:
“He has been a bad man, this Luc. And now, if one were to
bet by the law of probability, it would be three to one that Luc
would go to pot [<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sera perdu</i>], with his rhymings and his banterings,
and his injustices and politics, all as bad as himself.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>Frederick affected great contempt for public opinion. He
wrote to Voltaire:</p>

<p>“I have the lot of all actors who play in public—applauded
by some, despised by others. One must prepare one’s self for
satires, for calumnies, for a multitude of lies, which will be sent
abroad into currency against one. But need that trouble my
tranquillity? I go my road. I do nothing against the interior
voice of my conscience. And I concern myself very little in
what way my actions paint themselves in the brain of beings not
always very thinking, with two legs, and without feathers.”</p>

<p>It is evident that the king, thus surrounded with perils and
threatened with utter destruction, was anxious for the termination
of the war. But still this inflexible man would not listen
to any suggestions for peace but on his own terms. He wrote
to Voltaire, urging him “to bring back peace.” At the same
time he said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
“In spite of all your efforts, you will not get a peace signed
by my hands except on conditions honorable to my nation.
Your people, blown up with self-conceit and folly, may depend
on these words.”</p>

<p>But that he was fully awake to his perils, and keenly felt his
sufferings, is manifest from the following extract from another
of his letters:</p>

<p>“The sword and death have made frightful ravages among us.
And the worst is that we are not yet at the end of the tragedy.
You may judge what effect these cruel shocks make on me. I
wrap myself in my stoicism the best I can. Flesh and blood revolt
against such tyrannous command, but it must be followed.
If you saw me you would scarcely know me again. I am old,
broken, gray-headed, wrinkled. I am losing my teeth and my
gayety. If this go on, there will be nothing of me left but the
mania of making verses, and an inviolable attachment to my duties,
and to the few virtuous men whom I know.”</p>

<p>In the above letter the king alludes to the “mania of making
verses.” Strange as it may seem, he this winter, when apparently
almost crushed beneath the weight of cares and sorrows,
when every energy of mind and body seemed called into requisition
in preparation for a new campaign, published an edition of
his poems.</p>

<p>The allies represented a population of ninety millions. The
realms of Frederick embraced scarcely five millions of inhabitants.
The allies decided that they would no longer make an
exchange of prisoners. It was manifest that, by merely protracting
the war, even without any signal successes on the part of the
allies, Frederick would find all his resources of men exhausted.
Frederick, who was never very scrupulous with regard to the
means which he employed for the promotion of his ends, immediately
compelled his prisoners of war, of whatever nationality,
to enlist in his service.</p>

<p>“Prisoners, captive soldiers, if at all likely fellows,” writes Archenholtz,
“were by every means persuaded and even compelled
to take Prussian service. Compelled, cudgel in hand, not asked
if they wished to serve, but dragged to the Prussian colors,
obliged to swear there, and fight against their countrymen.”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
Frederick also seized money wherever he could find it, whether
in the hands of friend or foe. His contributions levied upon
the Saxons were terrible. The cold and dreary winter passed
rapidly away. The spring was late in that northern clime. It
was not until the middle of June that either party was prepared
vigorously to take the field. It was generally considered by the
European world that Frederick was irretrievably ruined. In
the last campaign he had lost sixty thousand men. Universal
gloom and discouragement pervaded his kingdom. Still Frederick,
by his almost superhuman exertions, had marshaled another
army of one hundred thousand men. But the allies had two
hundred and eighty thousand to oppose to them. Though Frederick
in public assumed a cheerful and self-confident air, as if assured
of victory, his private correspondence proves that he was,
in heart, despondent in the extreme, and that scarcely a ray of
hope visited his mind. To his friend D’Argens he wrote:</p>

<p>“I am unfortunate and old, dear marquis. That is why they
persecute me. God knows what my future is to be this year.
I grieve to resemble Cassandra with my prophecies. But how
augur well of the desperate situation we are in, and which goes
on growing worse? I am so gloomy to-day I will cut short.</p>

<p>“Write to me when you have nothing better to do. And
don’t forget a poor philosopher who, perhaps to expiate his incredulity,
is doomed to find his purgatory in this world.”</p>

<p>Again, and at the same time, he wrote to another friend:</p>

<p>“The difficulties I had last campaign were almost infinite,
there were such a multitude of enemies acting against me. Pomerania,
Brandenburg, Saxony, frontiers of Silesia, were alike in
danger, and often all at one time. If I escaped absolute destruction,
I must impute it chiefly to the misconduct of my enemies,
who gained such advantages, but had not the sense to follow
them up. Experience often corrects people of their blunders.
I can not expect to profit by any thing of that kind on their
part in the course of this campaign.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>Four campaigns of the Seven Years’ War have passed. We
are now entering upon the fifth, that of 1760. The latter part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
of April Frederick broke up his encampment at Freiberg, and
moved his troops about twenty miles north of Dresden. Here
he formed a new encampment, facing the south. His left wing
was at Meissen, resting on the Elbe. His right wing was at the
little village of Katzenhäuser, about ten miles to the southwest.
Frederick established his head-quarters at Schlettau, midway of
his lines. The position thus selected was, in a military point of
view, deemed admirable. General Daun remained in Dresden
“astride” the Elbe. Half of his forces were on one side and half
on the other of the river.</p>

<p>The stunning news soon reached Frederick that General Fouquet,
whom he had left in Silesia with twelve thousand men, had
been attacked by a vastly superior force of Austrians. The assault
was furious in the extreme. Thirty-one thousand Austrians
commenced the assault at two o’clock in the morning. By
eight o’clock the bloody deed was done. Ten thousand of the
Prussians strewed the field with their gory corpses. Two thousand
only escaped. General Fouquet himself was wounded and
taken prisoner. To add to the anguish of the king, this disaster
was to be attributed to the king himself. He had angrily ordered
General Fouquet to adopt a measure which that general,
better acquainted with the position and forces of the foe, saw to
be fatal. Heroically he obeyed orders, though he knew that it
would prove the destruction of his army.</p>

<p>Silesia was at the mercy of the foe. Frederick regarded the
calamity as irreparable. Still in a few hours he recovered his
equanimity, and in public manifested his accustomed stoicism.
The victorious Austrian soldiers in Silesia conducted themselves
like fiends. Their plunderings and outrages were too shocking
to be recited. “Nothing was spared by them,” writes Frederick,
“but misery and ugliness.”</p>

<p>There was a small garrison at Glatz, at Silesia, which, though
closely besieged, still held out against the Austrians. Frederick
thought that if he could by any stratagem draw General Daun
from Dresden, he could, by a sudden rush, break down its walls
and seize the city. He moved with celerity which completely
deceived the Austrian commander. At two o’clock in the morning
of Wednesday, July 2d, his whole army was almost on the
run toward Silesia. They marched as troops never marched before.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
For twelve hours their speed was unintermitted. The
next day, in utter exhaustion, they rested. But on Friday, as
the village clocks were tolling the hour of midnight, all were
again on the move, the king himself in front. Again it was a
run rather than a march through a dreary realm of bogs, wild
ravines, and tangled thickets. At three o’clock on Saturday
morning the march was resumed.</p>

<p>General Daun was soon informed of this energetic movement.
He instantly placed himself at the head of sixty thousand troops,
and also set out, at his highest possible speed, for Glatz.</p>

<p>Sunday, July 6th, was a day of terrible heat. At three o’clock
in the morning the Prussian troops were again in motion. There
was not a breath of wind. The blazing sun grew hotter and
hotter. There was no shade. The soldiers were perishing of
thirst. Still the command was “onward,” “onward.” In that
day’s march one hundred and five Prussian soldiers dropped
dead in their tracks.</p>

<p>General Daun thought that such energy as this could not be
a feint. He was much nearer to Glatz than was Frederick. Monday,
July 7th, the Prussian troops rested. General Daun pressed
on. Tuesday night he was two days’ march ahead of Frederick.
In the mean time, the Prussian king, who had made this
tremendous march simply to draw the foe from Dresden, suddenly
turned, and with the utmost velocity directed his troops
back toward the city.</p>

<p>General Maguire had been left in Dresden with but about
fourteen thousand men for its defense. On Saturday, July 13th,
the Prussian army appeared before the city. All the night they
were erecting their batteries. Early Sunday morning the cannonade
began. As Daun might speedily arrive at the head of
sixty thousand troops for the relief of the garrison, the bombardment
was conducted with the utmost possible energy. Day and
night the horrible tempest fell upon the doomed city. Adversity
had soured the king’s disposition, and rendered him merciless.
He had no compassion upon the innocent inhabitants. It was
his aim, at whatever cost, to secure the immediate surrender of
the place. He cruelly directed his terrific fire upon the thronged
dwellings rather than upon the massive fortifications. Street
after street blazed up in flames. It was Frederick’s relentless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
plan by “fire torture” to force the citizens to compel Maguire to
the surrender. But the Austrian commander hardened his heart
against the misery of the Saxon people, and held the place.</p>

<p>General Daun was proverbially slow-footed. For thirteen days
the wretched city burned and bled. In a memorial to the world,
which the King of Poland, as Elector of Saxony, published on
the occasion, he said,</p>

<p>“Had the enemy attacked Dresden according to the rules and
the customs of war, had they directed their efforts against the
ramparts, the king would, without doubt, have lamented the evils
which would have resulted from it to his people, but he would
have lamented them without complaining. But the Prussians
made war on the innocent townsmen. Their fire was wholly directed
against the houses. They endeavored to destroy a town
which they could not take.”</p>

<p>In truth, when General Daun approached, and Frederick saw
that there was no possibility of his taking the city, he, in the
wantonness of his rage, set fire to upward of a hundred houses
in the suburbs which had hitherto escaped the flames. Three
hundred and fifty houses were destroyed within the walls. More
than that number were half destroyed, shattered by bombs, and
scorched with flames. These were terrible calamities falling upon
a city already exhausted by four years of the most desolating
war. The King of Poland closed his appeal by saying,</p>

<p>“The king thinks it scarcely worth while to mention his palaces
and his gardens sacked and ruined, in contempt of the regard
usually paid from one sovereign to another. Is there a
man in all Europe who does not see in these terrible effects an
implacable hatred and a destructive fury which all nations ought
to concur in repressing?”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>Frederick, being constrained by the approach of General Daun
to raise the siege of Dresden, retired to his intrenched camp at
Schlettau. Leaving fifteen thousand men to guard the camp, he,
on the 1st of August, before the dawn, crossed the Elbe, and was
again on the rapid march toward Silesia. His army consisted
of thirty thousand men, and was accompanied by two thousand
heavy baggage-wagons. In five days the king marched over one
hundred miles, crossing five rivers. Armies of the allies, amounting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
to one hundred and seventy-five thousand Austrians and
Russians, were around him—some in front, some in his rear, some
on his flanks.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>On the 14th of August Frederick had reached Liegnitz. His
foes surrounded him in such numbers that escape seemed impossible,
and destruction sure. General Loudon, with thirty-five
thousand allies, was scarcely a mile east of him. General Lacy,
with an immense swarm of cavalry, was at the distance of but a
few thousand yards on the west. General Daun, with his immense
army, approaching from the southwest, had taken possession
of Liegnitz. Frederick was encamped upon some heights a
few miles east of the city. To human view, the position of his
Prussian majesty was desperate.</p>

<p>“He was clinging on the head of slippery abysses, his path
hardly a foot’s breadth, mere enemies and avalanches hanging
round on every side; ruin likelier at no moment of his life.”</p>

<p>On the night of the 14th Frederick had stationed his lines
with the greatest care to guard against surprise. At midnight,
wrapped in his cloak, and seated on a drum by a watch-fire, he
had just fallen asleep. An Irish officer, a deserter from the Austrians,
came blustering and fuming into the camp with the announcement
that General Lacy’s army was on the march to attack
Frederick by surprise. Frederick sprang to his horse. His
perfectly drilled troops were instantly in motion. By a rapid
movement his troops were speedily placed in battle array upon
the heights of the Wolfsberg. They would thus intercept the
enemy’s line of march, would take him by surprise, and were in
the most admirable position to encounter superior numbers. To
deceive the foe, all the Prussian camp-fires were left burning.
General Loudon had resorted to the same stratagem to deceive
Frederick.</p>

<p>To the surprise of General Loudon, there was opened upon
his advance-guard of five thousand men, as it was pressing forward
on its stealthy march, in the darkness ascending an eminence,
the most destructive discharge of artillery and musketry.
The division was hurled back with great slaughter. Gathering
re-enforcements, it advanced the second and the third time with
the same results. Cavalry, infantry, artillery, were brought forward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
but all in vain. Frederick brought into action but fifteen
thousand men. He utterly routed the hostile army of thirty-five
thousand men, killing four thousand, and taking six thousand
prisoners. He also captured eighty-two cannon, twenty-eight
flags, and five thousand muskets. His own loss was eighteen
hundred men. The battle commenced at three o’clock in the
morning, and was over at five o’clock.</p>

<p>Frederick remained upon the field of battle four hours gathering
up the spoils. The dead were left unburied. The wounded
were placed in empty meal-wagons. General Loudon fled
precipitately across the Katzbach River. To deceive the Austrians
in reference to his movements, Frederick wrote a false dispatch
to his brother Henry, which he placed in the hands of a
trusty peasant. The peasant was directed to allow himself to
be taken. The plan worked to a charm. The other portions of
the allied army, deceived by the dispatch, retreated as Frederick
wished to have them. He soon formed a junction with his
brother Henry, and being astonished himself at his almost miraculous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
escape, marched to the strong fortress of Breslau, which
was still held by a small Prussian garrison, and where he had
large magazines.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding this wonderful victory and narrow escape,
it still seemed that Frederick’s destruction was only postponed
for a short time. He was in the heart of Silesia, and was
surrounded by hostile armies three times more numerous than
his own.</p>

<p>Twelve days after the battle of Liegnitz Frederick wrote as
follows to his friend, the Marquis D’Argens, who was at Berlin.
The letter was dated Hermannsdorf, near Breslau, 27th of August,
1760:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Formerly, my dear marquis, the affair of the 15th would have
decided the campaign. At present it is but a scratch. A great
battle must determine our fate. Such we shall soon have. Then,
should the event prove favorable to us, you may, with good reason,
rejoice. I thank you for your sympathy. It has cost much
scheming, striving, and address to bring matters to this point.
Do not speak to me of dangers. The last action cost me only a
coat and a horse. That is buying victory cheap.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>“I never in my life was in so bad a posture as in this campaign.
Miracles are still needed to overcome the difficulties
which I foresee. I do my duty as well as I can. But remember,
my dear marquis, that I can not command good fortune. I am
obliged to leave too much to chance, as I have not the means to
render my plans more certain.</p>

<p>“I have the labors of Hercules to perform, at an age, too, when
my strength is leaving me, when my infirmities increase, and, to
speak the truth, when hope, the only consolation of the unhappy,
begins to desert me. You are not sufficiently acquainted
with the posture of affairs to know the dangers which threaten
the state. I know them, but conceal them. I keep all my fears
to myself, and communicate to the public only my hopes and the
trifle of good news I may now and then have. If the blow I
now meditate succeeds, then, my dear marquis, will be the time
to express our joy. But, till then, do not let us flatter ourselves,
lest unexpected bad news deject us too much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
“I live here the life of a literary monk. I have much to think
of about my affairs. The rest of my time I give to literature,
which is my consolation. I know not if I shall survive this war.
Should it so happen, I am resolved to pass the rest of my days
in retirement, in the bosom of philosophy and friendship.</p>

<p>“As soon as the roads are surer I hope you will write more
frequently. I do not know where we shall have our winter
quarters. Our houses at Breslau have been destroyed in the
late bombardment. Our enemies envy us every thing, even the
air we breathe. They must, however, leave us some place. If
it be a safe one, I shall be delighted to receive you there.</p>

<p>“Here is business which I must attend to. I was in a writing
vein, but I believe it is better to conclude, lest I should tire you
and neglect my own duties. Adieu, my dear marquis. I embrace
you.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">Sieges,</span> skirmishes, battles innumerable ensued. The Russians
and the Austrians, in superior numbers and with able leaders,
were unwearied in their endeavors to annihilate their formidable
foe. The conflict was somewhat analogous to that which takes
place between the lion at bay in the jungle and a pack of dogs.
The details could scarcely be made intelligible to the reader, and
would certainly prove tedious.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>Frederick so concentrated his forces as, ere long, to have about
fifty thousand troops with him at Breslau. Weary weeks of
marchings and fightings, blood and woe, passed on. Painful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
blows were struck upon both sides, but nothing decisive was accomplished.
In the midst of these harassments, perils, and toils,
the king wrote to D’Argens, on the 18th of September, from
Reisendorf:</p>

<p>“I will not sing <em>jeremiades</em> to you, nor speak of my fears or
anxieties; but I can assure you that they are great. The crisis
I am in changes in appearance, but nothing decisive happens. I
am consumed by a slow fire; I am like a living body losing limb
after limb. May Heaven assist us, for we have much need
of it.</p>

<p>“You speak of my personal safety. You ought to know, as I
do, that it is not necessary for me to live. But while I do live
I must fight for my country, and save it if it be possible. In
many little things I have had luck; I think of taking for my
motto, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Maximus in minimis, et minimus in maximis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>“It is impossible for you to imagine the horrible fatigues
which we undergo. This campaign is worse than any of the
others. I sometimes know not which way to turn. But why
weary you with these details of my toils and miseries? My spirits
have forsaken me. All my gayety is buried with those dear
and noble ones to whom my heart was bound. The end of my
life is melancholy and sad; but do not, therefore, my dear marquis,
forget your old friend.”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<p>To his brother Henry he wrote, “I have had a bad time of it,
my dear brother; our means are so eaten away; far too short
for opposing the prodigious number of our enemies set against
us. If we must fall, let us date our destruction from the infamous
day of Maxen. My health is a little better, but I have
still <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">hémorroïdes aveugles</i>. That were nothing, however, were it
not for the disquietudes I feel. For these three days I have had
so terrible a cramp in continuance that I thought it would choke
me. It is now a little gone. No wonder that the chagrins and
continual disquietudes I live in should undermine, and at length
overturn, the most robust constitution.”</p>

<p>Early in October the allies planned an expedition for the capture
of Berlin. The city had no defenses but weak palisades,
which were garrisoned by but twelve hundred men. General
Czernichef led a column of twenty thousand Russians, General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
Lacy another of fifteen thousand Austrians, and General Soltikof
a third column of twenty thousand more.</p>

<p>On the 3d of October the vanguard of this army, three thousand
strong, was seen in the distance from the steeples of Berlin.
The queen and royal family fled with the archives to Magdeburg.
The city was summoned to an immediate surrender, and to pay
a ransom of about four million dollars to rescue it from the
flames. The summons was rejected. General Tottleben, in command
of the advance, erected his batteries, and at five o’clock in
the afternoon commenced his bombardment with red-hot balls.
In the night a re-enforcement of five thousand Prussians, under
Prince Eugene of Würtemberg, who had marched forty miles
that day, entered the city, guided by the blaze of the bombardment,
to strengthen the garrison. Tottleben retired to await the
allied troops, which were rapidly on the march. In the mean
time, on the 8th, General Hülsen arrived with nine thousand
Prussian troops, increasing the garrison in Berlin to fifteen thousand.
Frederick was also on the march, to rescue his capital,
with all the troops he could muster. But the Russians had now
arrived to the number of thirty-five thousand. The defenses
were so weak that they could easily take or destroy the place.</p>

<p>The garrison retired to avoid capture. Berlin surrendered on
the morning of October 9th. For three days the enemy held
the city. The semi-barbaric soldiers committed fearful outrages.
The soldiers sacked the king’s palaces at Potsdam and Charlottenburg,
smashing furniture, doors, windows, mirrors, statuary,
cutting the pictures, and maltreating the inmates.</p>

<p>On the 11th it was announced that Frederick, with nearly the
whole Prussian army, was within five days’ march of Berlin.
The allies held him in such dread, when he had any thing like
an equality of numbers with them, that they fled from him at
the rate of thirty miles a day. But terrible were the ravages
which they inflicted on the Prussian people during this retreat.</p>

<p>The Russians marched to Poland. The Austrians returned to
Saxony. As soon as Frederick heard of their retreat, instead of
continuing his march to Berlin, he also turned his columns southward.
On the 27th of October he crossed the Elbe, about sixty
miles above Dresden, and found himself in the vicinity of General
Daun, whose army outnumbered that of Frederick two to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
one. The situation of Frederick was extremely critical. Under
these circumstances, he wrote to D’Argens on the 28th:</p>

    <div class="caption">SACKING THE PALACE.</div></div>

<p>“You, as a follower of Epicurus, put a value upon life. As
for me, I regard death from the Stoic point of view. Never shall
I see the moment which will oblige me to make a disadvantageous
peace. No persuasion, no eloquence, shall ever induce me to
sign my own dishonor. Either I will bury myself under the
ruins of my country, or, if that consolation appears too great to
the <em>Destiny</em> which persecutes me, I shall know how to put an
end to my misfortunes when it is no longer possible to bear
them. I have acted, and continue to act, in pursuance of this
conviction, and according to the dictates of honor, which have
always directed my steps. My conduct shall continue, at all
times, to be conformable to these principles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
“After having sacrificed my youth to my father, and my maturer
age to my country, I think that I have acquired the right
to dispose of my old age as I please. I have told you, and I repeat
it, my hand shall never sign a disgraceful peace. I shall
continue this campaign with the resolution to dare all, and to
try the most desperate things, either to succeed or to find a glorious
end.</p>

<p>“Indeed, how many reasons has one at fifty years of age to
despise life! The prospect which remains to me is an old age
of infirmity and pain, with disappointments, regrets, ignominies,
and outrages to endure. In truth, if you really consider my situation,
you ought to blame my intentions less than you do. I
have lost all my friends. I am unfortunate in all the ways in
which it is possible to be so. I have nothing to hope for. I
see my enemies treat me with derision, while their insolence prepares
to trample me under foot. Alas!</p>

<p>“I have nothing to add to this. I will only inform your curiosity
that we passed the Elbe the day before yesterday; that
to-morrow we march toward Leipsic, where I hope to be on the
31st, where I hope we shall have a battle, and whence you shall
receive news of us as it occurs.”</p>

<p>It is not strange that Frederick, being destitute of religious
principle, should have ever contemplated suicide as his last resort.
On the 2d of November the king came in sight of the encampment
of General Daun at Torgau, on the Elbe, some score
of leagues north of Dresden. The king was at the head of forty-four
thousand troops. Marshal Daun had eighty thousand,
strongly intrenched upon heights west of the city, in the midst
of a labyrinth of ponds, hills, ravines, and forests. We shall not
attempt to enter into a detail of the battle. The following plan
of the battle will give the military reader an idea of the disposal
of the forces.</p>

<p>The position of the Austrians on the heights of Siptitz, an
eminence which rose two hundred feet above the bed of the river,
seemed impregnable. Sixty-five thousand Austrians stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
upon those heights, protected by earth-works and a formidable
abatis. They had four hundred guns in battery, a larger number
than had ever before been brought upon a battle-field. To
attack then and there was an act of desperation. On the evening
of the 2d the king assembled his generals and said to them,</p>

<p>“I have called you together, not to ask your advice, but to inform
you that to-morrow I shall attack Marshal Daun. I am
aware that he occupies a strong position, but it is one from which
he can not escape. If I beat him, all his army must be taken
prisoners or drowned in the Elbe. If we are beaten, we must
all perish. This war is become tedious. You must all find it
so. We will, if we can, finish it to-morrow. General Ziethen, I
confide to you the right wing of the army. Your object must
be, in marching straight to Torgau, to cut off the retreat of the
Austrians when I shall have beaten them, and driven them from
the heights of Siptitz.”</p>

<p>At an early hour on the morning of the 3d Frederick broke
up his camp south of the foe, and, by a circuitous route of fourteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
miles, came down upon the Austrians from the north.
General Ziethen marched in almost a straight line for Torgau, to
cut off the retreat. It was two o’clock in the afternoon when
Frederick, emerging from the forest, ordered his men to charge.
The assault was as impetuous and reckless as mortal men could
possibly make. Instantly four hundred pieces of artillery opened
fire upon them.</p>

<p>“Archenholtz describes it as a thing surpassable only by
doomsday; clangorous rage of noise risen to the infinite; the
boughs of the trees raining down upon you with horrid crash;
the forest, with its echoes, bellowing far and near, and reverberating
in universal death-peal, comparable to the trump of doom.”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<p>Frederick exclaimed, in astonishment, “What an infernal fire!
Did you ever hear such a cannonade before? I never did.”</p>

<p>The first assault was made by six thousand grenadiers upon
the extreme western wing of the Austrian army. The terrible
conflict lasted nearly an hour. The Prussians were driven back,
leaving nine out of ten of the assailing force dead or wounded
behind them. The Austrians pursued, and encountered slaughter
equal to that which they had inflicted.</p>

<p>New columns were formed. Soon after three another charge
was ordered. It was sanguinary and unsuccessful as the first.
Frederick himself was wounded by a nearly spent case-shot which
struck him on the breast. The blow was severe and painful.
Had the ball retained a little more impetus it would have passed
through his body. It is said that the ball struck him to the
earth, and that for some time he was void of consciousness.
Upon reviving, his first words to his adjutant, a son of Old Dessauer,
who was sorrowfully bending over him, were, “What are
you doing here? Go and stop the runaways.”</p>

<p>It was now half past four o’clock. The sun of the short November
day was rapidly sinking. Hasty preparations were
made for another charge, aided by a body of Prussian cavalry
which had just reached the ground. The gathering twilight
was darkening hill and valley as the third assault was made.
It was somewhat successful. By this time the two armies were
quite intermingled. Marshal Daun was severely wounded, and
was taken into Torgau to have his wounds dressed. The hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
of six had now arrived. It was a damp, cloudy, dark night.
The combatants were guided mainly by the flash of the muskets
and the guns. “The night was so dark,” says Archenholtz,
“that you could not see your hand before you.” Still for two
hours the battle raged.</p>

<p>Marshal Daun, as he retired with a shattered leg to have his
wound dressed, resigned the command to General Buccow. In
a few moments his arm was shot off, and General O’Donnell took
the command. He ordered a retreat. The Austrian army, at
nine o’clock in the evening, in much disorder, were crossing the
Elbe by three bridges which had been thrown across the stream
in preparation for a possible disaster. The king, disappointed in
a victory which did not promise great results, passed the night
conversing with the soldiers at their watch-fires. He had ever
indulged them in addressing him with much familiarity, calling
him Fritz, which was a diminutive of Frederick, and expressive
of affection. “I suppose, Fritz,” said one of the soldiers, “after
this, you will give us good winter quarters.”</p>

<p>“By all the devils,” exclaimed the king, “I shall not till we
have taken Dresden. Then I will provide for you to your heart’s
content.”</p>

<p>The king was not a man of refined sensibilities. Not unfrequently
his letters contained coarse and indelicate expressions.
He was very profane. Voltaire says of him, “He has a pleasing
tone of voice even in swearing, which is as familiar to him as to
a grenadier.”</p>

<p>The battle of Torgau is to be numbered among the most
bloody of the Seven Years’ War. The Austrians lost twelve
thousand in killed and wounded, eight thousand prisoners, forty-five
cannon, and twenty-nine flags. The Prussian loss was also
very heavy. There were fourteen thousand killed or wounded,
and four thousand taken prisoners.</p>

<p>The Austrians retired to Dresden for winter quarters. Frederick
was left in the field which he had won. Gradually he
withdrew to his old camping-ground at Freiberg, where his troops
had been cantoned the previous winter. On the 10th of November,
1760, he wrote from Meissen to the Marquis D’Argens
at Berlin:</p>

<p>“I drove the enemy to the gates of Dresden. They occupy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
their camp of last year. All my skill is not enough to dislodge
them. We have saved our reputation by the day of Torgau.
But do not imagine that our enemies are so disheartened as to
desire peace. I fear that the French will preserve through the
winter the advantages they have gained during the campaign.</p>

<p>“In a word, I see all black, as if I were at the bottom of a
tomb. Have some compassion on the situation I am in. Conceive
that I disguise nothing from you, and yet that I do not
detail to you all my embarrassments, my apprehensions, and
troubles. Adieu, my dear marquis. Write to me sometimes.
Do not forget a poor devil who curses ten times a day his fatal
existence, and could wish he already were in those silent countries
from which nobody returns with news.”</p>

<p>The next day, the 11th, Frederick wrote from Neustadt to the
Countess of Camas, who at Berlin was the grand mistress of the
queen’s household. The trifling tone of this letter, which was
penned in the midst of a struggle so awful, is quite characteristic
of the writer:</p>

<p>“I am punctual in answering, and eager to satisfy you. You
shall have a breakfast-set, my good mamma; six coffee-cups, very
pretty, well diapered, and tricked out with all the little embellishments
which increase their value. On account of some pieces
which they are adding to the set, you will have to wait a few
days. But I flatter myself this delay will contribute to your
satisfaction, and produce for you a toy that will give you pleasure,
and make you remember your old adorer.</p>

<p>“It is curious how old people’s habits agree. For four years
past I have given up suppers as incompatible with the trade I
am obliged to follow. On marching days my dinner consists of
a cup of chocolate.</p>

<p>“We have been running about like fools, quite inflated with
our victory, to see if we could not chase the Austrians out of
Dresden. But they made mockery of us from the tops of their
mountains. So I have withdrawn, like a naughty little boy, to
hide myself, out of spite, in one of the most cursed villages of
Saxony. We must now drive these gentlemen of the imperial
army out of Freiberg in order to get something to eat and a place
to sleep in.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
“This is, I swear to you, such a dog’s life [<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chienne de vie</i>] as
no one but Don Quixote ever led before me. All this tumbling,
toiling, bother, and confusion have made me such an old fellow
that you would scarcely know me again. The hair on the right
side of my head has grown quite gray. My teeth break and fall
out. My face is as full of wrinkles as the furbelow of a petticoat.
My back is bent like a fiddle-bow, and my spirit is sad
and downcast, like a monk of La Trappe.</p>

<p>“I forewarn you of this, that, if we should meet again in flesh
and bone, you might not feel yourself too violently shocked by
my appearance. There remains nothing to me unaltered but my
heart, which, as long as I breathe, will retain sentiments of esteem
and tender friendship for my good mamma. Adieu.”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></p>

<p>On Saturday, the 25th of October of this year, George II., King
of England, died. The poor old gentleman, who had been endowed
with but a very ordinary share of intelligence, was seventy-seven
years of age. On Monday he had presided at a review
of troops in Hyde Park. On Thursday he stood upon the
portico of his rural palace in Kensington to see his Guards march
by for foreign service. Saturday morning he rose at an early
hour, took his cup of chocolate as usual, and, opening his windows,
said the morning was so fine he would take a walk in his
garden. It was then eight o’clock. His valet withdrew with
the cup and saucer. He had hardly shut the door when he
heard a groan and a fall. Hurrying back, he found the king
upon the floor. Faintly the death-stricken monarch exclaimed,
“Call Amelia,” and instantly died.</p>

<p>“Poor deaf Amelia (Frederick’s old love, now grown old and
deaf) listened wildly for some faint sound from those lips now
mute forever. George II. was no more. His grandson, George
III, was now king.”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p>George II. had always hated his nephew Frederick. His only
object in sustaining the war was to protect his native electorate
of Hanover and to abase France.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> The new sovereign, in his
first speech to Parliament, said:</p>

<p>“I rely upon your zeal and hearty concurrence to support the
King of Prussia and the rest of my allies, and to make ample<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>
provision for carrying on the war, as the only means of bringing
our enemies to equitable terms of accommodation.”</p>

<p>It seems that in England there were two parties in reference
to the war. Sir Horace Walpole, in a letter under date of December
5th, 1760, wrote to Sir Horace Mann, at Florence:</p>

<p>“I shall send you a curious pamphlet, the only work I almost
ever knew that changed the opinions of many. It is called ‘Considerations
on the present German War.’ The confirmation of
the King of Prussia’s victory near Torgau does not prevent the
disciples of the pamphlet from thinking that the best thing which
could happen for us would be to have that monarch’s head shot
off.”<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the opposition, Parliament voted to continue
the subsidy to Frederick of about three million four hundred
thousand dollars (£670,000). This sum was equal to twice or
three times that amount at the present day.</p>

<p>Frederick, having cantoned his troops at Freiberg and its vicinity,
on the 27th of November wrote again to the Countess of
Camas:</p>

<p>“We have settled our winter quarters. I have yet a little
round to take, and afterward I shall seek for tranquillity at Leipsic,
if it be to be found there. But, indeed, for me tranquillity
is only a metaphysical word which has no reality.”</p>

<p>Frederick was so busy cantoning his troops that he did not
take possession of his head-quarters in Leipsic until the 8th of
December. He occupied the Apel House, No. 16 Neumarkt
Street, the same which he had occupied before the battle of Rossbach.
The same mistress kept the house as before. Upon seeing
the king, the good woman exclaimed, in astonishment, “How
lean your majesty has grown!”</p>

<p>“Lean indeed I am,” the king replied. “And what wonder,
with three women<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> hanging on the throat of me all this while!”</p>

<p>Thus ended the fifth campaign of the Seven Years’ War.
Though the king had thus far averted the destruction which
seemed every hour to be impending, his strength and resources
were so rapidly failing that it seemed impossible that he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
much longer continue the struggle. Under these despairing circumstances,
the king, with an indomitable spirit, engaged vigorously
in gathering his strength for a renewal of the fight in the
spring.</p>

<p>“In the midst of these preparations for a new campaign against
a veteran army of two hundred and eighty thousand enemies,
Frederick yet found sufficient leisure for peaceable occupations.
He consecrated some hours every day to reading, to music, and
to the conversation of men of letters.”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>D’Argens spent the winter with the king at Leipsic. He
gives the following incident: “One day I entered the king’s
apartment, and found him sitting on the floor with a platter of
fried meat, from which he was feeding his dogs. He had a little
rod, with which he kept order among them, and shoved the best
bits to his favorites.”</p>

<p>The marquis looked for a moment upon the singular spectacle
with astonishment. Then raising his hands, he exclaimed,</p>

<p>“The five great powers of Europe, who have sworn alliance,
and conspired to ruin the Marquis of Brandenburg, how might
they puzzle their heads to guess what he is now doing! Scheming
some dangerous plan, think they, for the next campaign, collecting
funds, studying about magazines for man and horse; or
is he deep in negotiations to divide his enemies, and get new allies
for himself? Not a bit of it. He is sitting peaceably in
his room feeding his dogs.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<p>The king was quite unscrupulous in the measures to which he
resorted to recruit his army. Deserters, prisoners, peasants, were
alike forced into the ranks. Even boys but thirteen and fourteen
years of age were seized by the press-gangs. The countries
swept by the armies were so devastated and laid waste that it
was almost an impossibility to obtain provisions for the troops.
It will be remembered that upon the capture of Berlin several
of the king’s palaces had been sacked by the Russian and Austrian
troops. The king, being in great want of money, looked
around for some opportunity to retaliate. There was within his
cantonments a very splendidly furnished palace, called the Hubertsburg
Schloss, belonging to the King of Poland. On the
21st of January, 1761, Frederick summoned to his audience-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
General Saldern. This officer cherished a very high sense of
honor. The bravest of the brave on the field of battle, he recoiled
from the idea of performing the exploits of a burglar.
The following conversation took place between the king and his
scrupulous general. In very slow, deliberate tones, the king
said:</p>

<p>“General Saldern, to-morrow morning I wish you to go with
a detachment of infantry and cavalry to Hubertsburg. Take
possession of the palace, and pack up all the furniture. The
money they bring I mean to bestow on our field hospitals. I
will not forget <em>you</em> in disposing of it.”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, your majesty,” General Saldern replied, “but
this is contrary to my honor and my oath.”</p>

<p>The king, in still very calm and measured words, rejoined,
“You would be right if I did not intend this desperate method
for a good object. Listen to me. Great lords don’t feel it in
their scalp when their subjects are torn by the hair. One has
to grip their own locks as the only way to give them pain.”</p>

<p>“Order me, your majesty,” said General Saldern, “to attack
the enemy and his batteries, and I will cheerfully, on the instant,
obey; but I can not, I dare not, act against honor, oath, and
duty. For this commission your majesty will easily find another
person in my stead.”</p>

<p>The king turned upon his heel, and, with angry voice and gesture,
said, “Saldern, you refuse to become rich.”</p>

<p>In a pet Frederick left the room. The heroic general, who
had flatly refused to obey a positive command, found it necessary
to resign his commission. The next day another officer plundered
the castle. Seventy-five thousand dollars of the proceeds
of the sale were appropriated to the field hospitals. The remainder,
which proved to be a large sum, was the reward of the
plundering general.</p>

<p>“The case was much canvassed in the army. It was the topic
in every tent among officers and men. And among us army
chaplains, too, the question of conflicting duties arose. Your
king ordering one thing, and your conscience another, what ought
a man to do? And what ought an army chaplain to preach or
advise?</p>

<p>“Our general conclusion was that neither the king nor General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
Saldern could well be called in the wrong. General Saldern,
in obeying the inner voice, did certainly right. But the king,
also, in his place, might judge such a measure expedient. Perhaps
General Saldern himself would have done so had he been
King of Prussia.”<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<p>The Duke of Mecklenburg had a sister, Charlotte, a bright
and beautiful young girl of seventeen. Her heart was so moved
by the scenes of misery which she witnessed every where around
her that she ventured to write a very earnest appeal to Frederick
for peace.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It was but a few years ago,” she wrote, “that this territory
wore the most pleasing appearance. The country was cultivated.
The peasants looked cheerful. The towns abounded with riches
and festivity. What an alteration at present from such a charming
scene! I am not expert at description, neither can my fancy
add any horrors to the picture. But sure even conquerors themselves
would weep at the hideous prospect now before me.</p>

<p>“The whole country, my dear country, lies one frightful waste,
presenting only objects to excite terror, pity, and despair. The
business of the husbandman and the shepherd are quite discontinued.
The husbandman and shepherd are become soldiers
themselves, and help to ravage the soil they formerly occupied.
The towns are inhabited by old men, women, and children. Perhaps
here and there a warrior, rendered unfit for service by
wounds and want of limbs, is left at his door. His little children
hang round him, ask a history of every wound, and grow
themselves soldiers before they find strength for the field.</p>

<p>“But this were nothing did we not feel the alternate insolence
of either army as it happens to advance or retreat. It is impossible
to express the confusion which even those create who call
themselves our friends. Even those from whom we might expect
redress oppress us with new calamities. From you, therefore,
it is that we expect relief. To you even women and children
may complain, for your humanity stoops to the most humble
petition, and your power is capable of repressing the greatest
injustice. I am, sire, etc.,</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">Charlotte Sophia</span>, of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.”
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
This letter was extensively circulated in England. It was
greatly admired. It so happened that the court was then looking
around for a bride for their young king. The result was
that in the course of a few months Charlotte became Queen of
England, as the wife of George III.</p>

<p>It is not known that Frederick paid any attention to this appeal.
Impoverished as his realms were, large sums of money
were absolutely necessary for the conduct of a new campaign.
The king levied a contribution upon Leipsic of nearly a million
of dollars. The leading citizens said that in their extreme destitution
it was impossible to raise that sum. The king threatened
to burn down the city over their heads. The combustibles
were gathered. The soldiers stood with the torches in their
hands to kindle the conflagration. But then the king, apparently
reflecting that from the smouldering ashes of the city he could
glean no gold, ordered the city to be saved, but arrested a hundred
of the chief merchants and threw them into prison.</p>

<p>These men, of the highest distinction, were treated with every
indignity to extort the money from them. They were incarcerated
in gloomy dungeons, with straw only for their beds, and
with bread and water only for their food. But even this severity
was unavailing. Seventeen were then selected from their
number, and were informed that they were to be forced into the
ranks as common soldiers. Their muskets and their knapsacks
were given to them, and they were ordered to Magdeburg to be
drilled. By this application of torture the money was obtained.
And now, while the storms of winter were sweeping the frozen
fields, both parties were gathering their strength anew for the
struggle of the sixth campaign.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">The</span> fifth campaign of the Seven Years’ War closed with the
year 1760. By exertions such as mortal man perhaps never
made before, Frederick succeeded, during the winter, in raising
an army of ninety-six thousand men. In the mean time the allies
had concentrated in Bohemia, to crush him, seventy-two thousand
Austrians and sixty thousand Russians. The capture of
four fortresses would drive Frederick hopelessly out of Silesia.
Early in May, Frederick, leaving his brother Henry with about
forty thousand men to protect Saxony, set out with fifty thousand
for the relief of Neisse, which was then besieged. General
Goltz, probably the most able of the Prussian commanders, was
detached to the fortified camp at Glogau.</p>

<p>“But, alas! poor Goltz, just when ready to march, was taken
with sudden, violent fever, the fruit probably of overwork; and
in that sad flame blazed away his valiant existence in three or
four days; gone forever, June 30, 1761, to the regret of Frederick
and of many.”<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>The Russians were entering Silesia from the northeast by
the way of Poland. Frederick, by one of his incredibly rapid
marches, for a time prevented the junction of the two hostile
armies. After innumerable marchings and manœuvrings, during
which Frederick displayed military ability which commanded
the admiration even of his foes, the Prussian king found himself,
on the 16th of August, at Nicolstadt, in the very heart of Silesia,
at the head of fifty-seven thousand men. In front of him, obstructing
his advance, there were sixty thousand Russians. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>
his rear, cutting off his retreat, there were seventy-two thousand
Austrians. From a commanding eminence Frederick could watch
the movements of both of these hostile bands. Both Russians
and Austrians stood in such awe of the prowess of their redoubtable
antagonist that they moved cautiously, like hounds surrounding
the lion at bay.</p>

<p>At three o’clock in the morning of the 20th of August, and
after the march of a few hours, the little army of Frederick commenced
constructing a fortified camp near the poor little village
of Bunzelwitz, about half way between the Silesian fortresses of
Schweidnitz and Striegau. Spades were provided. Fifty thousand
men were instantly employed, according to a well-matured
plan, in digging and trenching. The extraordinary energies of
Frederick seemed to nerve every arm. Here there was speedily
reared the camp of Bunzelwitz, which has attained world-wide
renown.</p>

<p>An ordinary eye would not have seen in the position any peculiar
military strength. It was an undulating plain about eight
miles long and broad, without any abrupt eminences. A small
river bordered it on the west, beyond which rose green hills. On
the east was the almost impregnable fortress of Schweidnitz, with
its abundant stores. Farm-houses were scattered about, with
occasional groves and morasses. There were also sundry villages
in the distance.</p>

<p>Frederick himself was chief engineer. The army was divided
into two forces of twenty-five thousand each. Carlyle gives a
graphic description of this enterprise.</p>

<p>“And twenty-five thousand spades and picks are at work, under
such a field engineer as there is not in the world when he
takes to that employment. At all hours, night and day, twenty-five
thousand of them: half the army asleep, other half digging,
wheeling, shoveling; plying their utmost, and constant as
Time himself: these, in three days, will do a great deal of spadework.
Batteries, redoubts, big and little; spare not for digging.
Here is ground for cavalry, too. Post them here, there, to bivouac
in readiness, should our batteries be unfortunate. Long
trenches are there, and also short; batteries commanding every
ingate, and under them are mines.”</p>

<p>Many of the trenches were sixteen feet broad by sixteen feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
deep. Under each battery there were two mines. In case of
capture, the mines and the victors could be blown high into the
air. Knowing that the batteries were all mined, the Russian
and Austrian soldiers would be slow to make charges in which
victory would be certain death. The small villages around were
all strongly fortified.</p>

<p>“Würben, in the centre, is like a citadel looking down upon
Striegau Water. Heavy cannon, plenty of them, we have brought
from Schweidnitz. We have four hundred and eighty cannon
in all, and one hundred and eighty-two mines. Würben, our
citadel and centre, is about five miles from Schweidnitz. Before
our lines are palisades and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chevaux-de-frise</i>. Woods we have in
abundance in our circuit, and axes for carpentries of that kind.
There are four intrenched knolls; twenty-four big batteries capable
of playing beautifully, all like pieces in a concert.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p>Frederick had been three days and nights at work upon his
fortress before the allies ventured forward to look into it. It
was then a Gibraltar. Still for eight days more the spade was
not intermitted. Cogniazo, an Austrian, writes: “It is a masterpiece
of art, in which the principles of tactics are combined with
those of field fortifications as never before.”</p>

<p>The Austrians took position upon the south, at the distance
of about six miles. The Russians were at the same distance on
the west, with their head-quarters at Hohenfriedberg.</p>

<p>It would seem that Frederick’s troops must have had iron
sinews, and that they needed as little repose as did their master.
Those not at work with the spade were under arms to repel an
assault. Two or three times there was an alarm, when the whole
fifty thousand, in an hour, were in battle-array. Frederick was
fully aware of the crisis he had encountered. To be beaten
there was irretrievable ruin. No one in the army performed
more exhausting labor than the king himself. He seemed to
be omnipresent, by day and by night. Near the chief battery,
in a clump of trees, there was a small tent, and a bundle of straw
in the corner. Here the king occasionally sought a few moments
of repose. But his nervous excitement rendered him so
restless, that most of the time he was strolling about among the
guard parties, and warming himself by their fires.</p>

    <div class="caption">THE KING’S BIVOUAC.</div></div>

<p>“One evening,” writes Carlyle, “among the orders is heard
this item: ‘And remember a lock of straw, will you, that I may
not have to sleep upon the ground, as last night!’ Many anecdotes
are current to this day about his pleasant, homely ways,
and affabilities with the sentry people, and the rugged hospitalities
they would show him at their watch-fires. ‘Good evening,
children.’ ‘The same to thee, Fritz.’ ‘What is that you are
cooking?’—and would try a spoonful of it, in such company;
while the rough fellows would forbid smoking. ‘Don’t you
know he dislikes it?’ ‘No! smoke away,’ the king would insist.”</p>

<p>General Loudon was in command of the Austrians, and General
Butturlin of the Russians, who were arrayed against Frederick.
They could not agree upon a plan of attack. Neither
commander was willing to expose his troops to the brunt of a
battle in which the carnage would necessarily be dreadful.
Thus the weeks wore away. Frederick could not be safely attacked,
and winter was approaching.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock at night on the 9th of September, the Russian
camp went up in flame. The next morning not a Russian was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
to be seen. The whole army had disappeared over the hills far
away to the north. Frederick immediately dispatched eight
thousand men under General Platen to attack the flank of the
retreating foe, and destroy his baggage-wagons. The feat was
brilliantly accomplished. On the 15th of September, before the
dawn of the morning, General Platen fell upon the long train,
took nearly two thousand prisoners, seven cannon, and destroyed
five thousand heavily-laden wagons.</p>

<p>Frederick remained at Bunzelwitz a fortnight after the retreat
of the Russians. In the mean time the French and English were
fighting each other with varying success upon the banks of the
Rhine. It is not necessary to enter into the details of their
struggles. Frederick’s magazines at Schweidnitz were getting
low. On the 26th of September he broke up his camp at Bunzelwitz,
and in a three days’ march to the southeast reached
Neisse. The Austrians did not venture to annoy him. Frederick
had scarcely reached Neisse when he learned, to his amazement
and horror, that General Loudon, with a panther-like spring,
had captured Schweidnitz, with its garrison and all its supplies.
It was a terrible blow to the king. The Austrians could now
winter in Silesia. The anguish of Frederick must have been
great. But he gave no utterance to his gloomy forebodings.</p>

<p>“The king,” writes Küster, “fell ill of the gout, saw almost
nobody, never came out. It was whispered that his inflexible
heart was at last breaking. And for certain there never was in
his camp and over his dominions such a gloom as in this October,
1761, till at length he appeared on horseback again, with a
cheerful face; and every body thought to himself, ‘Ha! the world
will still roll on, then.’”</p>

<p>Frederick’s treatment of the unfortunate General Zastrow, who
was in command at Schweidnitz, was quite peculiar. Very generously
he wrote to him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear General Von Zastrow</span>,—The misfortune which
has befallen me is very grievous. But what consoles me in it is
to see by your letter that you have behaved like a brave officer,
and that neither you nor your garrison have brought disgrace
or reproach upon yourselves. I am your well-affectioned king.</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">Frederick.</span>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
“P.S.—You may, in this occurrence, say what Francis I., after
the battle of Pavia, wrote to his mother: ‘All is lost except
honor.’ As I do not yet completely understand the affair, I forbear
to judge of it, for it is altogether extraordinary.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Notwithstanding this letter, Frederick refused to give General
Zastrow any further employment, but left him to neglect, obscurity,
and poverty. Zastrow wrote to the king imploring a
court-martial. He received the following laconic reply:</p>

<p>“It is of no use. I impute nothing of crime to you. But after
such a mishap it would be dangerous to trust you with any
post or command.”</p>

<p>The freezing gales of winter soon came, when neither army
could keep the open field. Frederick established his winter
quarters at Breslau. General Loudon, with his Austrians, was
about thirty miles southwest of him at Kunzendorf. Thus ended
the sixth campaign.</p>

<p>The winter was long, cold, and dreary. Fierce storms swept
the fields, piling up the snow in enormous drifts. But for this
cruel war, the Prussian, Russian, and Austrian peasants, who had
been dragged into the armies to slaughter each other, might
have been in their humble but pleasant homes, by the bright
fireside, in the enjoyment of all comforts.</p>

<p>“The snow lies ell-deep,” writes Archenholtz; “snow-tempests,
sleet, frost. The soldiers bread is a block of ice, impracticable
to human teeth till you thaw it.”</p>

<p>It was on the 9th of December that the king, after incredible
exposure to hunger, and cold, and night-marchings, established
himself for the winter in the shattered apartments of his ruined
palace at Breslau. He tried to assume a cheerful aspect in public,
but spent most of his hours alone, brooding over the ruin
which now seemed inevitable. He withdrew from all society,
scarcely spoke to any body except upon business. One day
General Lentulus dined with him, and not one word was spoken
at the table. On the 18th of January, 1762, the king wrote in
the following desponding tones to D’Argens:</p>

<p>“The school of patience I am at is hard, long-continued, cruel,
nay, barbarous. I have not been able to escape my lot. All
that human foresight could suggest has been employed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>
nothing has succeeded. If Fortune continues to pursue me,
doubtless I shall sink. It is only she that can extricate me from
the situation I am in. I escape out of it by looking at the universe
on the great scale, like an observer from some distant planet.
All then seems to me so infinitely small; and I could almost
pity my enemies for giving themselves such trouble about
so very little.</p>

<p>“What would become of us without philosophy, without this
reasonable contempt of things frivolous, transient, and fugitive,
about which the greedy and ambitious make such a pother, fancying
them to be solid! This is to become wise by stripes, you
will tell me. Well, if one do become wise, what matters it how?
I read a great deal. I devour my books, and that brings me
useful alleviation. But for my books, I think hypochondria
would have had me in Bedlam before now. In fine, dear marquis,
we live in troublous times and in desperate situations. I
have all the properties of a stage hero—always in danger, always
on the point of perishing. One must hope that the conclusion
will come, and if the end of the piece be lucky, we will forget
the rest.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<p>“The darkest hour is often nearest the dawn.” The next day
after Frederick had written the above letter he received news
of the death of his most inveterate enemy, Elizabeth, the Empress
of Russia. As we have mentioned, she was intensely exasperated
against him in consequence of some sarcasms in which
he had indulged in reference to her private life. Elizabeth was
the daughter of Peter the Great, and had inherited many of her
father’s imperial traits of character. She was a very formidable
foe.</p>

<p>“Russia may be counted as the bigger half of all he had to
strive with; the bigger, or at least the far uglier, more ruinous,
and incendiary; and, if this were at once taken away, think what
a daybreak when the night was at the blackest.”<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<p>The nephew of Elizabeth, and her successor, Peter III., was a
very warm admirer of Frederick. One of his first acts was to
send to the Prussian king the assurance of his esteem and friendship.
Peter immediately released all the Prussian prisoners in
his dominions, entered into an armistice with Frederick, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>
was soon followed by a treaty of alliance. The two sovereigns
commenced a very friendly correspondence. Frederick returned
all the Russian prisoners, well clothed and fed, to their homes.
The change was almost as sudden and striking as the transformations
in the kaleidoscope. On the 23d Peter issued a decree
that there was peace with Prussia, that he had surrendered to
his Prussian majesty all the territorial conquests thus far made,
and had recalled the Russian armies.</p>

<p>Peter III. had been left an orphan, and titular Duke of Schleswig-Holstein,
when eleven years of age. His mother was a daughter
of Peter the Great. His aunt, the Czarina Elizabeth, who
had determined not to marry, adopted the child, and pronounced
him to be her heir to the throne. Being at that time on friendly
terms with Frederick, the Empress Elizabeth had consulted
him in reference to a wife for the future czar. It will be remembered
that the king effected a marriage between Peter and Sophia,
the beautiful daughter of a Prussian general, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst,
and at that time commandant of Stettin. His wife
was sister to the heir-apparent of Sweden. Carlyle, speaking of
this couple, says:</p>

<p>“They have a daughter, Sophie-Frederike, now near fifteen,
and very forward for her age; comely to look upon, wise to listen
to. ‘Is not she the suitable one?’ thinks Frederick in regard
to this matter. ‘Her kindred is of the oldest—old as Albert
the Bear. She has been frugally brought up, Spartan-like, though
as a princess by birth. Let her cease skipping ropes on the ramparts
yonder with her young Stettin playmates, and prepare for
being a czarina of the Russias,’ thinks he. And communicates
his mind to the czarina, who answers, ‘Excellent! How did I
never think of that myself!’”</p>

<p>This was in January, 1744. The young lady, with her mother,
by express invitation, and with this object in view, visited the
Russian court. Sophia embraced the Greek religion, received
in baptism the new name of Catharine, and on the 1st of September,
1745, was married to her second cousin Peter. “And
with invocation of the Russian heaven and Russian earth they
were declared to be one flesh, though at last they turned out to
be <em>two fleshes</em>, as my reader well knows.”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

    <div class="caption">THE EMPRESS CATHARINE.</div></div>

<p>About a year before this, on
the 17th of July, 1744, Frederick’s
sister Ulrique had been
married to Adolf Frederick, the
heir-apparent to the throne of
Sweden. Eighteen years of this
weary world’s history, with its
wars and its woes, had since
passed away. On the 5th of
April, 1751, the old king of Sweden
died. Thus Adolf became
king, and Frederick’s sister Ulrique
Queen of Sweden. And
now, on the 5th of January, 1762,
the Empress of Russia died, and
Peter III., with his wife Catharine,
ascended the throne of that majestic empire.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of Russia from the alliance against Frederick,
though hailed by him with great joy, still left him, with wasted
armies and exhausted finances, to struggle single-handed against
Austria and France united, each of which kingdoms was far
more powerful than Prussia. The winter passed rapidly away
without any marked events, each party preparing for the opening
of the campaign in the ensuing spring. On the 8th of June,
1762, Frederick wrote to D’Argens:</p>

<p>“In fine, my dear marquis, the job ahead of me is hard and
difficult, and nobody can say positively how it will all go. Pray
for us; and don’t forget a poor devil who kicks about strangely
in his harness, who leads the life of one damned.”</p>

<p>Peter III. was a drunken, brutal, half-crazed debauchee. Catharine
was a beautiful, graceful, intellectual, and dissolute woman.
They hated each other. They did not even pretend to be faithful
to each other. Catharine formed a successful conspiracy, dethroned
her husband, and was proclaimed by the army sole empress.
After a series of the wildest scenes of intrigue, corruption,
and crime, the imbecile Peter III., who had fled to the remote
palace of Ropscha, was murdered, being first compelled to
drink of poison, and then, while writhing in pain, he was strangled
with a napkin. Whether Catharine were a party to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>
assassination is a question which can now probably never be decided.
It is certain that she must have rejoiced over the event,
and that she richly rewarded the murderers.</p>

    <div class="caption">ASSASSINATION OF PETER III.</div></div>

<p>In the following curious proclamation, the Empress Catharine
II. announced to her subjects the death of her husband:</p>

<p>“The seventh day after our accession to the throne of all the
Russias we received information that the late emperor, Peter III.,
was attacked with a violent colic. That we might not be wanting
in Christian duty, or disobedient to the divine command by
which we are enjoined to preserve the life of our neighbor, we
immediately ordered that the said Peter should be furnished
with every thing that might be judged necessary to restore his
health by the aids of medicine. But, to our great regret and affliction,
we were yesterday evening apprized that, by permission
of the Almighty, the late emperor departed this life.”</p>

<p>The seventh campaign of the Seven Years’ War commenced
on the 1st of July, 1762. Peter III. had sent an army of twenty
thousand men to the support of Frederick. Aided by these
troops, united with his own army, Frederick had emerged from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
his winter quarters, and was just about to attack the Austrian
army, which was intrenched upon the heights of Burkersdorf, a
little south of Schweidnitz, which fortress the Austrians then
held. The evening before the contemplated attack the Russian
General Czernichef entered the tent of Frederick with the following
appalling tidings:</p>

<p>“There has been a revolution in St. Petersburg. The Czar
Peter III., your majesty’s devoted friend, has been deposed, and
probably assassinated. The Czarina Catharine, influenced by
the enemies of your majesty, and unwilling to become embroiled
in a conflict with Austria and France, has ordered me to return
instantly homeward with the twenty thousand troops under my
command.”</p>

<p>For a moment the king was quite stunned by the blow. The
withdrawal of these troops would expose him to be speedily
overwhelmed by the Austrians. By earnest entreaty, Frederick
persuaded Czernichef to remain with him three days longer. “I
will require of you no service whatever. The Austrians know
nothing of this change. They will think that you are still my
ally. Your presence simply will thus aid me greatly in the battle.”</p>

<p>General Czernichef, though at the risk of his head from the
displeasure of Catharine, generously consented so far to disobey
the orders of his empress. The next day, July 2, 1762, Frederick,
with his remaining troops, attacked the foe, under General
Daun, at Burkersdorf. From four o’clock in the morning until
five in the afternoon the antagonistic hosts hurled themselves
against each other. Frederick was the victor. “On fall of
night, Daun, every body having had his orders, and been making
his preparations for six hours past, ebbed totally away, in
perfect order, bag and baggage; well away to southward, and
left Frederick quit of him.”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>Early the next morning, Czernichef, greatly admiring the exploit
Frederick had performed, commenced his march home.
Just before this there was a change in the British ministry, and
the new cabinet clamored for peace. England entered into a
treaty with France, and retired from the conflict. Frederick, vehemently
upbraiding the English with treachery—the same kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>
of treachery of which he had repeatedly been guilty—marched
upon Schweidnitz. After a vigorous siege of two months he
captured the place.</p>

<p>Nearly all of Silesia was again in the hands of Frederick. He
seems to have paid no regard to the ordinary principles of honor
in the accomplishment of his plans. Indeed, he seems to have
had no delicate perceptions of right and wrong, no instinctive
appreciation of what was honorable or dishonorable in human
conduct. He coined adulterated money, which he compelled the
people to take, but which he refused to receive in taxes. In his
<cite>Military Instructions</cite>, drawn up by his own hand, he writes:</p>

<p>“When you find it very necessary, yet very difficult, to gain
any intelligence of the enemy, there is another expedient, though
a cruel one. You take a rich burgher, possessed of rich lands, a
wife, and children. You oblige him to go to the enemy’s camp,
as if to complain of hard treatment, and to take along with him,
as his servant, a spy who speaks the language of the country;
assuring him at the same time that, in case he does not bring the
spy back with him, after having remained a sufficient time in the
enemy’s camp, you will set fire to his house, and massacre his
wife and children. I was forced to have recourse to this cruel
expedient. It answered my purpose.”<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p>A man’s moral nature must be indeed obtuse who could thus
recommend the compulsion of a peaceable citizen to act the part
of a traitor to his own country, under the alternative of having
his house fired and his wife and children massacred.</p>

<p>Winter was now approaching. The Austrians in Saxony
made a desperate attack upon Prince Henry, and were routed
with much loss. The shattered Austrian army retired to Bohemia
for winter quarters. Under the circumstances, it was a victory
of immense importance to Frederick. Upon receiving the
glad tidings, he wrote to Henry:</p>

<p>“Your letter, my dear brother, has made me twenty years
younger. Yesterday I was sixty, to-day hardly eighteen. I bless
Heaven for preserving your health, and that things have passed
so happily. It is a service so important rendered by you to the
state that I can not enough express my gratitude, and will wait
to do it in person.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>
On the 24th of November the belligerents entered into an armistice
until the 1st of March. All were exhausted. It was
manifest that peace would soon be declared. Commissioners to
arrange the terms of peace met at the castle of Hubertsburg, near
Dresden. On the 15th of February, 1763, peace was concluded.
<em>Frederick retained Silesia</em>. That was the result of the war.</p>

<p>According to Frederick’s computation, he had succeeded in
wresting this province from Maria Theresa at an expense of eight
hundred and fifty-three thousand lives, actual fighters, who had
perished upon the field of battle. Of these, one hundred and
eighty thousand were Prussians. Of the hundreds of thousands
of men, women, and children who, in consequence of the war, had
perished of exposure, famine, and pestilence, no note is taken.
The population of Prussia had diminished, during the seven
years, five hundred thousand.</p>

<p>The day in which the treaty was signed Frederick wrote to
the Marquis D’Argens as follows: “The best thing I have now
to tell you of, my dear marquis, is the peace. And it is right
that the good citizens and the public should rejoice at it. For
me, poor old man that I am, I return to a town where I know
nothing but the walls, where I find no longer any of my friends,
where great and laborious duties await me, and where I shall
soon lay my old bones in an asylum which can neither be troubled
by war, by calamities, nor by the wickedness of men.”</p>

<p>Archenholtz, who was an eye-witness of the miseries which he
describes, gives the following account of the state of Germany at
the close of the conflict:</p>

<p>“Whole provinces had been laid waste. Even in those which
had not been thus destroyed, internal commerce and industry
were almost at an end. A great part of Pomerania and Brandenburg
was changed into a desert. There were provinces
where hardly any men were to be found, and where the women
were therefore obliged to guide the plow. In others women
were as much wanting as men. The most fertile plains of Germany,
on the banks of the Oder and the Wesel, presented only
the arid and sterile appearance of a desert. An officer has stated
that he had passed through seven villages without meeting a
single person excepting a curate.”<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p>On the 15th of March, 1763, Frederick left Leipsic, and on the
30th entered his capital of Berlin, from which he had been absent
six years. It was nine o’clock in the evening when his carriage
drove through the dark and silent streets to his palace.
His arrival at that hour had not been anticipated. It is said
that he repaired immediately to the queen’s apartment, where
he met the several members of the royal family. As soon as it
was known that the king had arrived, Berlin blazed with illuminations
and rang with rejoicings.</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">There</span> still remained to Frederick twenty-three years of life.
He now engaged very vigorously in the endeavor to repair the
terrible ravages of war by encouraging agriculture, commerce,
and all useful arts. He invited the distinguished French philosophers
Helvetius and D’Alembert to visit his court, and endeavored,
though unavailingly, to induce them to take up their
residence in Berlin. They were both in sympathy with the king
in their renunciation of Christianity.</p>

<p>There are many anecdotes of Frederick floating about in the
journals whose authenticity can not be vouched for. The two
following are doubtless authentic. Frederick, as he was riding
through the streets of Berlin, saw a crowd looking upon a picture
which was posted high up on a wall. He requested his
groom to see what it was. The servant returned with the reply,
“It is a caricature of your majesty, seated on a stool, with a
coffee-mill between your knees, grinding with one hand, and picking
up the beans which have fallen with the other,”</p>

<p>“Take it down,” said the king, “and hang it lower, that the
people may not hurt their necks in looking at it.”</p>

<p>The crowd heard what he said. With bursts of laughter they
tore the caricature in pieces, scattered it to the winds, and greeted
the king, as he rode away, with enthusiastic shouts of “Our
Fritz forever.”</p>

<p>The Crown Prince Frederick had married the daughter of the
Duke of Brunswick. She was a very beautiful, proud, high-spirited
woman. Her husband was a worthless fellow, dissolute in
the extreme. She, stung to madness, and unrestrained by Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>
principle, retaliated in kind. A divorce was the result. The
discarded princess retired to the castle of Stettin, where she lived
in comparative seclusion, though surrounded with elegance.</p>

<div id="ip_537" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25.3125em;">

    <div class="caption">FREDERICK THE GREAT, ÆT. 59.</div></div>

<p>Upon one occasion she ordered a very rich silk dress directly
from Lyons. The custom-house dues were heavy. The custom-house
officer detained the dress until the dues should be paid.
The haughty princess, exceedingly indignant, sent an order to
him to bring the dress instantly to her, and she would pay the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
demand. As soon as he entered her apartment, she snatched
the dress from his hands, and with her open palm gave him two
slaps in the face, ordering him immediately to leave the house<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></p>

<p>The officer drew up a statement of the facts, and sent it to the
king, with the complaint that he had been dishonored in discharging
the duties intrusted to him by his majesty. The king
sent the following reply:</p>

<p>“To the custom-house officer at Stettin. The loss of the excise
dues shall fall to my score. The dress shall remain with
the princess; the slaps to him who received them. As to the
pretended dishonor, I entirely relieve the complainant from that.
Never can the appliance of a beautiful hand dishonor the face of
an officer of customs.”</p>

<p>Frederick, with his own pen, gives the following account of
this family quarrel, which resulted in the divorce of the Crown
Prince and Elizabeth:</p>

<p>“Not long ago we mentioned the Prince of Prussia’s marriage
with Elizabeth of Brunswick. The husband, young and dissolute,
given up to a profligate life, from which his relatives could
not correct him, was continually committing infidelities to his
wife. The princess, who was in the flower of her beauty, felt
outraged by such neglect of her charms. Her vivacity and the
good opinion she had of herself brought her upon the thought
of avenging her wrongs by retaliation. Speedily she gave into
excesses scarcely inferior to those of her husband. Family quarrels
broke out, and were soon publicly known. The antipathy
which ensued took away all hope of succession. The brothers
of the king, Henry and Ferdinand, avowed frankly that they
would never consent to have, by some accidental birth, their
rights of succession to the crown carried off. In the end, there
was nothing for it but proceeding to a divorce.”<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></p>

<p>Within three months after the divorce, the Crown Prince, anxious
for an heir, married, on the 18th of April, 1769, the Princess
Frederica Louisa, of Hesse-Darmstadt. A son was born to them,
who became Frederick William III.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span>
Under the energetic administration of Frederick, Prussia began,
very rapidly, to recover from the desolation which had overwhelmed
it. The coin, in a little more than a year, was restored
to its purity. In the course of two years Frederick rebuilt, in
different parts of his realms, fourteen thousand five hundred
houses. The army horses were distributed among the impoverished
farmers for plow teams. Early in June, 1763, the king set
out on a general tour of inspection.</p>

<p>“To form an idea,” he writes, “of the general subversion, and
how great were the desolation and discouragement, you must
represent to yourself countries entirely ravaged, the very traces
of the old habitations hardly discoverable. Of the towns some
were ruined from top to bottom; others half destroyed by fire.
Of thirteen thousand houses the very vestiges were gone. There
was no field in seed, no grain for the food of the inhabitants.
Sixty thousand horses were needed if there were to be plowing
carried on. In the provinces generally there were half a million
population less than in 1756; that is to say, upon four millions
and a half the ninth man was wanting. Noble and peasant had
been pillaged, ransomed, foraged, eaten out by so many different
armies; nothing now left them but life and miserable rags.</p>

<p>“There was no credit by trading people even for the necessaries
of life. There was no police in the towns. To habits of
equity and order there had succeeded a vile greed of gain and
an anarchic disorder. The silence of the laws had produced in
the people a taste for license. Boundless appetite for gain was
their main rule of action. The noble, the merchant, the farmer,
the laborer, raising emulously each the price of his commodity,
seemed to endeavor only for their mutual ruin. Such, when the
war ended, was the fatal spectacle over these provinces, which
had once been so flourishing. However pathetic the description
may be, it will never approach the touching and sorrowful impression
which the sight of it produced.”</p>

<p>The absolutism of Frederick placed all legislative, judicial, and
executive powers in his hands. He was law-maker, judge, and
executioner. The liberty, property, and lives of his subjects
were at his disposal. He could call others to assist him in the
government, but they were merely servants to do his bidding.</p>

<p>“During the war,” writes Frederick, “the councilors and ministers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>
had successively died. In such time of trouble it had been
impossible to replace them. The embarrassment was to find persons
capable of filling these different employments. We searched
the provinces, where good heads were found as rare as in the
capital. At length five chief ministers were pitched upon.”</p>

<p>The rich abbeys of the Roman Catholics were compelled to
establish manufactures for weaving damasks and table-cloths.
Some were converted into oil-mills, or “workers in copper, wire-drawers,
the flaxes and metals, with water-power, markets, and
so on.”</p>

<p>While on this tour of inspection, the celebrated French philosopher
D’Alembert, by appointment, met the king at Geldern,
and accompanied him to Potsdam. D’Alembert was in entire
sympathy with the king in his renunciation of Christianity. In
1755 D’Alembert had, by invitation, met Frederick at Wesel, on
the Rhine. In a letter to Madame Du Deffand, at Paris, dated
Potsdam, June 25, 1763, D’Alembert wrote:</p>

<p>“I will not go into the praises of King Frederick, now my
host. I will merely send you two traits of him, which will indicate
his way of thinking and feeling. When I spoke to him
of the glory which he had acquired, he answered, with the greatest
simplicity,</p>

<p>“‘There is a furious discount to be deducted from said glory.
Chance came in for almost the whole of it. I would far rather
have written Racine’s <cite>Athalie</cite> than have performed all the
achievements of this war.’</p>

<p>“The other trait I have to give you is this. On the 15th of
February last, the day of concluding this peace, which is so glorious
to him, some one said to him, ‘It is the finest day of your
majesty’s life.’ The king replied,</p>

<p>“‘The finest day of life is the day on which one quits it.’”<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>Helvetius, another of the distinguished French deistical philosophers,
was invited to Berlin to assist the king in his financial
operations. To aid the mechanics in Berlin, and to show to the
world that the king was not so utterly impoverished as many
imagined, Frederick, on the 11th of June, 1763, laid the foundation
of the sumptuous edifice called “The New Palace of Sans
Souci.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>
Frederick, though now at peace with all the world, found no
nation in cordial alliance with him. He had always disliked
England, and England returned the dislike with interest. The
Duchess of Pompadour, who controlled France, hated him. Maria
Theresa regarded him as a highway robber who had snatched
Silesia from her and escaped with it. Frederick, thus left without
an ally, turned to his former subject, now Catharine II.,
whom he had placed on the throne of Russia. On the 11th of
April, 1764, one year after the close of the Seven Years’ War, he
entered into a treaty of alliance with the Czarina Catharine.
The treaty was to continue eight years. In case either of the
parties became involved in war, the other party was to furnish
a contingent of twelve thousand men, or an equivalent in money.</p>

<p>On the 5th of October, 1763, Augustus, the unhappy King of
Poland, had died at Dresden, after a troubled reign of thirty
years. The crown was elective. The turbulent nobles, broken
up into antagonistic and envenomed cliques, were to choose a
successor. Catharine, as ambitious as she was able and unprincipled,
resolved to place one of her creatures upon the throne,
that Poland, a realm spreading over a territory of 284,000 square
miles, and containing a population of 20,000,000, might be virtually
added to her dominions. Carlyle writes:</p>

<p>“My own private conjecture, I confess, has rather grown to be,
on much reading of those <cite>Rulhières</cite> and distracted books, that
the czarina—who was a grandiose creature, with considerable
magnanimities, natural and acquired; with many ostentations,
some really great qualities and talents; in effect, a kind of she
Louis Quatorze (if the reader will reflect on that royal gentleman,
and put him into petticoats in Russia, and change his improper
females for improper males)—that the czarina, very clearly
resolute to keep Poland hers, had determined with herself to
do something very handsome in regard to Poland; and to gain
glory, both with the enlightened philosophe classes and with her
own proud heart, by her treatment of that intricate matter.”</p>

<p>In the court of the czarina there was a very handsome young
Pole, Stanislaus Poniatowski, who had been an acknowledged
lover of Catharine. Though Catharine had laid him aside for
other favorites, she still regarded him with tender feelings. He
was just the man to do her bidding. By skillful diplomacy she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
caused him to be elected King of Poland. That kingdom was
now entirely in her hands, so far as it was in the power of its
monarch to place it there.</p>

<p>This, however, stirred up great strife in Poland. The nobles
were roused. Scenes of confusion ensued. The realm was
plunged into a state of anarchy. Frederick, being in cordial co-operation
with the czarina in all her measures, instructed his
minister in Warsaw to follow her policy in every particular. It
has generally been supposed that Frederick was the first to propose
the banditti division of the kingdom of Poland between
Prussia, Russia, and Austria by means of their united armies.
This is not certain. But, whoever may have at first made the
suggestion, it is very certain that Frederick cordially and efficiently
embarked in the enterprise.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<p>Poniatowski was elected King of Poland on the 7th of September,
1764, and crowned on the 25th of November. He was
then thirty-two years of age, and the scarcely disguised agent of
Catharine. Two or three years passed of wars and rebellions,
and all the usual tumult of this tumultuous world. In August,
1765, the Emperor Francis died. He was at Innsprück, attending
the marriage festivities of his second son Leopold. About
nine o’clock in the evening of the 18th, while sauntering through
the rooms in the midst of the brilliant gala, he was struck with
apoplexy. He staggered for a moment, fell into the hands of his
son Joseph, and instantly died.</p>

<p>Joseph, the oldest son of Maria Theresa and Francis, by the
will of his mother became emperor. But Maria Theresa still
swayed the sceptre of imperial power, through the hands of her
son, as she had formerly done through the hands of her amiable
and pliant husband. The young emperor was fond of traveling.
He visited all the battle-fields of the Seven Years’ War, and put
up many monuments. Through his minister at Berlin, he expressed
his particular desire to make the acquaintance of Frederick.
The interview took place at Neisse on the 25th of August,
1769. His majesty received the young emperor on the grand
staircase of the palace, where they cordially embraced each other.</p>

<p>“Now are my wishes fulfilled,” said the emperor, “since I have
the honor to embrace the greatest of kings and soldiers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>
“I look upon this day,” the king replied, “as the fairest of my
life; for it will become the epoch of uniting two houses which
have been enemies too long, and whose mutual interests require
that they should strengthen, not weaken, one another.”</p>

<p>There were dinner-parties, and military reviews, and operas to
beguile the time. The interview lasted three days. The king
and the emperor often walked out arm in arm. Frederick wrote:</p>

<p>“The emperor has a frankness of manner which seems natural
to him. In his amiable character, gayety and great vivacity are
prominent features.”</p>

<p>Under cover of these festivities important political matters
were discussed. The question of the partition of Poland arose,
and arrangements were made for another interview. Soon after
this, Frederick sent to Catharine a sketch of a plan for partitioning
several provinces in Poland—Russia, Prussia, and Austria
each taking a share. “To which Petersburg, intoxicated with
its own outlooks on Turkey, paid not the least attention.”<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> The
second interview, of five days, commenced on the 3d of September,
1770, at Neustadt, near Austerlitz, which has since become
so famous.</p>

<p>The Prince De Ligne, in a long letter to Stanislaus, King of
Poland, gives an interesting account of several conversations
which ensued. In this narrative he writes:</p>

<p>“I forget how the conversation changed. But I know that it
grew so free that, seeing somebody coming to join in it, the king
warned him to take care, saying that it was not safe to converse
with a man doomed by the theologians to everlasting fire. I felt
as if he somewhat overdid this of his ‘being doomed,’ and that
he boasted too much of it. Not to hint at the dishonesty of
these free-thinking gentlemen, who very often are thoroughly
afraid of the devil, it is at least bad taste to make display of such
things. And it was with the people of bad taste whom he had
about him, and some dull skeptics of his own academy, that he
had acquired the habit of mocking at religion.”</p>

<p>The king was not a little vain of the keen thrusts he could
occasionally give the clergy. In a letter to Marie-Antoine, Electress
of Saxony, dated Potsdam, May 3, 1768, he, with much apparent
complacency, records the following witty achievement:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>
“It is a pity for the human race, madam, that men never can
be tranquil. But they never can be any where. Even the little
town of Neufchâtel has had its troubles. Your royal highness
will be astonished to learn how. A parson there had set
forth in a sermon that, considering the immense mercy of God,
the pains of hell could not last forever. The synod shouted
murder at such scandal, and has been struggling ever since to
get the parson exterminated. The affair was of my jurisdiction,
for your royal highness must know that I am pope in that country.
Here is my decision:</p>

<p>“‘Let the parsons who make for themselves a cruel and barbarous
God be eternally damned, as they desire and deserve;
and let those parsons who conceive God gentle and merciful enjoy
the plenitude of his mercy.’</p>

<p>“However, madam, my sentence has failed to calm the minds.
The schism continues, and the number of damnatory theologians
prevail over the others.”<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p>The king could be very courteous. He gave a dinner-party,
at which General Loudon, one of the most efficient of the Austrian
generals, and who had often been successfully opposed to
Frederick, was a guest. As he entered the king said,</p>

<p>“General Loudon, take a seat by my side. I had much rather
have you with me than opposite me.” <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mettez vous auprès de
moi. J’aime mieux vous avoir à côté de moi que vis-à-vis.</i><a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></p>

<p>Catharine was at this time engaged vigorously in a war with
the Turks. Frederick, by his treaty with the czarina, was compelled
to assist her. This ambitious woman, endowed with extraordinary
powers, was pushing her conquests toward Constantinople,
having formed the resolve to annex that imperial city to
the empire, and thus to open through the Straits of the Bosphorus
and the Dardanelles new avenues for Russian commerce.</p>

<p>Count Von Kaunitz, an able but proud and self-conceited man,
was prime minister of the Emperor of Germany. His commanding
mind exerted quite a controlling influence over his imperial
master. Kaunitz records the following conversation as having
taken place at this interview between himself and Frederick:<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>
“These Russian encroachments upon the Turk,” said Kaunitz,
“are dangerous to the repose of Europe. His imperial majesty
can never consent that Russia should possess the provinces of
Moldavia and Wallachia. He will much rather go to war.
These views of Russia are infinitely dangerous to every body.
They are as dangerous to your majesty as to others. I can conceive
of no remedy against them but this. Prussia and Austria
must join frankly in protest and absolute prohibition of them.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing more at heart,” Frederick replied, “than to
stand well with Austria. I wish always to be her ally, never
her enemy. But the prince sees how I am situated. Bound by
express treaty with her czarish majesty, I must go with Russia in
any war. I will do every thing in my power to conciliate her
majesty with the emperor—to secure such a peace at St. Petersburg
as may meet the wishes of Vienna.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<p>Singularly enough, the very next day Frederick received an
express from the Divan requesting him, with the aid of Austria,
to mediate peace with Russia. The Turks had encountered such
reverses that they were anxious to sheathe the sword. Frederick
with great joy undertook the mediation. But he found the
mediation far more difficult than he had imagined. Catharine
and Maria Theresa, so totally different in character, entertained
a rooted aversion to each other. The complications were so great
that month after month the deliberations were continued unavailingly.
Maria Theresa was unrelentingly opposed to the advance
of Russia upon Constantinople.</p>

<p>Thus originated with the Empress Catharine, one hundred
years ago, the idea of driving the Turks out of Europe, and of
annexing Constantinople to her majestic empire. From that
time until now the question has been increasingly agitating the
courts of Europe. Every day, now, the “Eastern Question” is
assuming greater importance. The following map very clearly
shows the commanding position of Constantinople, and the
immense strength, both in a military and a commercial point of
view, it would give to the Russian empire.</p>

<p>Meneval, private secretary of Napoleon I., records that, in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span>
of the interviews of the emperor with Alexander, the czar offered
to co-operate with Napoleon in all his plans if the emperor would
consent that Russia should take Constantinople. The French
emperor replied, after a moment’s hesitation,</p>

<p>“Constantinople! never. It is the empire of the world.”</p>

<div id="ip_546" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img src="images/i_546.jpg" width="800" height="599" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">MAP OF THE EAST.</div></div>

<p>There can be but little doubt, however, that the Bosphorus
and the Dardanelles will ere long be in the hands of Russia.
“I know that I or my successors,” said the Czar Nicholas, “must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span>
have Constantinople. You might as well arrest a stream in its
descent from a mountain as the Russians in their advance to the
Hellespont.”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p>There was a famine in Poland, and the famine was followed
by pestilence. A general state of tumult and discord ensued.
Maria Theresa had gathered a large army on the frontiers of
Hungary to watch the designs of Russia upon Turkey. Availing
herself of this disturbed state of Poland, Maria Theresa
marched her troops into one of its provinces called Zips, which
had once belonged to Hungary, and quietly extended her boundaries
around the acquisition. Catharine was much exasperated
by the measure.</p>

<p>The czarina had, about that time, invited Prince Henry, the
warlike brother of Frederick, to visit her. They had met as children
when the czarina was daughter of the commandant at Stettin.
Henry was received with an extraordinary display of imperial
magnificence. In the midst of this routine of feasting,
balls, and masquerades, Catharine one day said to Henry, with
much pique, referring to these encroachments on the part of Maria
Theresa,</p>

<p>“It seems that in Poland the Austrians have only to stoop
and pick up what they like. If the court of Vienna has the intention
to dismember that kingdom, its neighbors will have the
right to take their share.”<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<p>Frederick caught eagerly at the suggestion, as the remark was
reported to him by his brother. He drew up a new plan of partition,
which he urged with all his powers of address upon both
Russia and Austria. The conscience of Maria Theresa was strongly
opposed to the deed. Catharine and Kaunitz were very greedy
in their demands. Circumstances assumed such an aspect that
it was very difficult for Maria Theresa to oppose the measure.
At length, through the extraordinary efforts of Frederick, on the
5th of August, 1772, the following agreement was adopted:</p>

<p>Russia took 87,500 square miles. Austria received 62,500.
The share which fell to Frederick was but 9456 square miles.
Small in respect to territory as was Frederick’s share, it was regarded,
in consequence of its position and the nature of the country,
equally valuable with the other portions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>
“Frederick’s share,” writes Mr. Carlyle, “as an anciently Teutonic
country, and as filling up the always dangerous gap between
his Ost Prussen and him, has, under Prussian administration,
proved much the most valuable of the three, and, next to
Silesia, is Frederick’s most important acquisition.”</p>

<p>In carrying out these measures of partition, which the world
has usually regarded as one of the most atrocious acts of robbery
on record, resort was had both to bribery and force. The King
of Poland was the obsequious servant of Catharine. A common
fund was raised by the three powers to bribe the members of
the Polish diet. Each of the confederate powers also sent an
army to the Polish frontiers, ready to unite and crush the distracted
people should there be any forcible resistance. Thus
the deed was accomplished.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa was a devout woman, governed by stern convictions
of duty. Her moral nature recoiled from this atrocious
act. But she felt driven to it by the pressure brought upon her
by her own cabinet, her powerful and arrogant prime minister,
and by the courts of Prussia and Russia. While, therefore, very
reluctantly giving her assent to the measure, she issued the following
extraordinary document:</p>

<p>“When all my lands were invaded, and I knew not where in
the world to be brought to bed in, I relied on my good right
and the help of God. But in this thing, where not only public
law cries to Heaven against us, but also all natural justice and
sound reason, I must confess never in my life to have been in
such trouble, and I am ashamed to show my face. Let the
prince (Kaunitz) consider what an example we are giving to all
the world, if, for a miserable piece of Poland, or of Moldavia, or
Wallachia, we throw our honor and reputation to the winds. I
see well that I am alone, and no more in vigor. Therefore I
must, though to my very great sorrow, let things take their
course.”<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p>A few days afterward, in an official document, she writes: “I
consent, since so many great and learned men will have it so.
But long after I am dead, it will be known what this violating
of all that was hitherto held sacred and just will give rise to.”<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span>
Frederick had cultivated a supreme indifference to public
opinion. Not believing in any God, in any future retribution,
or in any immortality, and regarding men merely as the insects
of an hour, like the myriad polyps which, beneath the ocean, rear
their stupendous structures and perish, his sense of right and
wrong must necessarily have been very different from that which
a believer in the Christian faith is accustomed to cherish. In
allusion to this subject, he writes:</p>

<p>“A new career came to open itself to me. And one must
have been either without address or buried in stupidity not to
have profited by an opportunity so advantageous. I seized this
unexpected opportunity by the forelock. By dint of negotiating
and intriguing, I succeeded in indemnifying our monarchy for its
past losses by incorporating Polish Prussia with my old provinces.
This acquisition was one of the most important we could
make, because it joined Pommern to East Prussia, and because,
rendering us masters of the Weichsel River, we gained the
double advantage of being able to defend that kingdom (East
Prussia), and to draw considerable tolls from the Weichsel, as
all the trade of Poland goes by that river.”</p>

<p>The region thus annexed to Prussia was in a deplorable state
of destitution and wretchedness. Most of the towns were in
ruins. War had so desolated the land that thousands of the
people were living in the cellars of their demolished houses.</p>

<p>“The country people hardly knew such a thing as bread.
Many had never tasted such a delicacy. Few villages possessed
an oven. A weaving-loom was rare; a spinning-wheel unknown.
The main article of furniture in this bare scene of squalor was
a crucifix, and a vessel of holy water under it. It was a desolate
land, without discipline, without law, without a master. On
nine thousand English square miles lived five hundred thousand
souls—not fifty-five to the square mile.”<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></p>

<p>With extraordinary energy and sagacity Frederick set about
developing the resources of his new acquisition. Houses were
built. Villages rose as by magic. Marshes were drained. Emigrants,
in large numbers, mechanics and farmers, were transported
to the new lands. Canals were dug. Roads were improved,
and new ones opened. One hundred and eighty-seven school-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span>masters
were sent into the country. Every where there was
plowing, ditching, building.</p>

<p>“As Frederick’s seven years’ struggle of war may be called
superhuman, so was there also, in his present labor of peace,
something enormous, which appeared to his contemporaries almost
preternatural, at times inhuman. It was grand, but also
terrible, that the success of the whole was to him, at all moments,
the one thing to be striven after. The comfort of the individual
was of no concern at all.”<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<p>The weal or woe of a single human polyp was, in the view of
Frederick, entirely unimportant in comparison with the great
enterprises he was ambitious of achieving. For this dismemberment
of Poland Frederick was severely assailed in a book entitled
“Polish Dialogues.” In answer to a letter from Voltaire,
he wrote, under date of March 2, 1775:</p>

<p>“The ‘Polish Dialogues’ you speak of are not known to me.
I think of such satires with Epictetus, ‘If they tell any truth of
thee, correct thyself. If they are lies, laugh at them.’ I have
learned, with years, to become a steady coach-horse. I do my
stage like a diligent roadster, and pay no heed to the little dogs
that will bark by the way.”</p>

<p class="firstpara"><span class="firstword">Toward</span> the end of the year 1775 the king had an unusually
severe attack of the gout. It was erroneously reported that it
was a dangerous attack of the dropsy, and that he was manifestly
drawing near to his end. The Crown Prince, who was to
succeed him, was a man of very little character. The Emperor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>
of Germany, Joseph II., thought the death of Frederick would
present him an opportunity of regaining Silesia for Austria.
The Austrian army was immediately put in motion and hurried
to the frontiers of Silesia, to seize the province the moment the
king should expire. This was openly done, and noised abroad.
Much to the disappointment of the emperor, the king got well.
Amidst much ridicule, the troops returned to their old quarters.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p>Frederick was probably not surprised at this act on the part
of the emperor. He undoubtedly had sufficient candor to admit
that it was exactly what he should have done under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>Catharine of Russia had a son, Paul, her heir to the throne.
It so chanced that she died just at the time Prince Henry of
Prussia was visiting St. Petersburg. Through his agency Paul
was induced to take as a second wife a niece of Frederick’s, the
eldest daughter of Eugene of Würtemberg. Thus the ties between
Russia and Prussia were still more strengthened, so far as
matrimonial alliances could strengthen them. The wedding
took place in Berlin on the 18th of October, 1776.</p>

<p>Several years now passed away with nothing specially worthy
of record. Frederick did not grow more amiable as he advanced
in years. Though Frederick was often unreasonable, petulant,
and unjust, and would seldom admit that he had been in the
wrong, however clear the case, it can not be doubted that it was
his general and earnest desire that justice should be exercised
in all his courts.</p>

<p>In September, 1777, the King of Bavaria died. The emperor
thought it a good opportunity to annex Bavaria to Austria.
“Do but look on the map,” says Carlyle, in his peculiar style of
thought and expression: “you would say, Austria without Bavaria
is like a human figure with its belly belonging to somebody
else. Bavaria is the trunk or belly of the Austrian dominions,
shutting off all the limbs of them each from the other;
making for central part a huge chasm.”</p>

<p>France would hardly object, since she was exhausted with
long wars. England was busy in the struggle with her North
American colonies. Russia was at war with the Turks. There
was no power to be feared but Prussia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span>
“Frederick,” said Kaunitz, “is old and broken. He can not
live long. Having suffered so much, he has an absolute horror
of war. We need not fear that he will again put his armies in
motion.”</p>

<p>But no sooner did Frederick get an intimation that Austria
was contemplating this enlargement of her domains than he
roused himself to prevent it with all the vigor of his earlier
years. It was a very delicate matter; for Charles Theodore, the
elector, and his nephew August Christian, heir to the electorate,
a young gentleman of very illustrious pedigree, but of a very
slender purse, had both been bribed by Austria secretly to co-operate
in the movement. The reader will be interested in Carlyle’s
account, slightly abbreviated, of Frederick’s skill in diplomacy:</p>

<p>“Heir is a gallant enough young gentleman. Frederick judges
that he probably will have haggled to sign any Austrian convention
for dismemberment of Baiern, and that he will start into
life upon it so soon as he sees hope.</p>

<p>“‘A messenger to him,’ thinks Frederick; ‘a messenger instantly;
and who?’ For that clearly is the first thing. And a
delicate thing it is; requiring to be done in profoundest secrecy,
by hint and innuendo rather than speech—by somebody in a
cloak of darkness, who is of adroit quality, and was never heard
of in diplomatic circles before, not to be suspected of having
business of mine on hand.</p>

<p>“Frederick bethinks him that in a late visit to Weimar he
had noticed, for his fine qualities, a young gentleman named
Görtz, late tutor to the young Duke Karl August, a wise, firm,
adroit-looking young gentleman, who was farther interesting as
brother to Lieutenant General Von Görtz, a respectable soldier
of Frederick’s. Ex-tutor at Weimar, we say, and idle for the
moment; hanging about court there, till he should find a new
function.</p>

<p>“Of this ex-tutor Frederick bethinks him; and in the course
of that same day—for there is no delay—Frederick, who is at
Berlin, beckons General Görtz to come over to him from Potsdam
instantly.</p>

<p>“‘Hither this evening, and in all privacy meet me in the palace
at such an hour’ (hour of midnight or thereby); which of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span>
course Görtz, duly invisible to mankind, does. Frederick explains:
an errand to München; perfectly secret, for the moment,
and requiring great delicacy and address; perhaps not without
risk, a timorous man might say: will your brother go for me,
think you? Görtz thinks he will.</p>

<p>“‘Here is his instruction, if so,’ adds the king, handing him an
autograph of the necessary outline of procedure—not signed, nor
with any credential, or even specific address, lest accident happen.
‘Adieu, then, herr general lieutenant; rule is, shoes of
swiftness, cloak of darkness: adieu!’</p>

<p>“And Görtz senior is off on the instant, careering toward
Weimar, where he finds Görtz junior, and makes known his errand.
Görtz junior stares in the natural astonishment; but, after
some intense brief deliberation, becomes affirmative, and in a
minimum of time is ready and on the road.</p>

<p>“Görtz junior proved to have been an excellent choice on the
king’s part, and came to good promotion afterward by his conduct
in this affair. Görtz junior started for München on the instant,
masked utterly, or his business masked, from profane eyes;
saw this person, saw that, and glided swiftly about, swiftly and
with sure aim; and speedily kindled the matter, and had smoke
rising in various points. And before January was out, saw the
Reisch-Diet, at Regensburg, much more the general gazetteerage
every where, seized of this affair, and thrown into paroxysms at
the size and complexion of it: saw, in fact, a world getting into
flame—kindled by whom or what nobody could guess for a long
time to come. Görtz had great running about in his cloak of
darkness, and showed abundant talent of the kind needed. A
pushing, clear-eyed, stout-hearted man; much cleverness and
sureness in what he did and forebore to do. His adventures
were manifold; he had much traveling about: was at Regensburg,
at Mannheim; saw many persons whom he had to judge
of on the instant, and speak frankly to, or speak darkly, or speak
nothing; and he made no mistake.</p>

<p>“We can not afford the least narrative of Görtz and his courses:
imagination, from a few traits, will sufficiently conceive them.
He had gone first to Karl Theodor’s minister: ‘Dead to it, I fear;
has already signed?’ Alas! yes. Upon which to Zweibrück, the
heir’s minister, whom his master had distinctly ordered to sign,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span>
but who, at his own peril, gallant man, delayed, remonstrated,
had not yet done it; and was able to answer:</p>

<p>“‘Alive to it, he? Yes, with a witness, were there hope in the
world!’ which threw Görtz upon instant gallop toward Zweibrück
Schloss in search of said heir, the young Duke August
Christian; who, however, had left in the interim (summoned by
his uncle, on Austrian urgency, to consent along with him), but
whom Görtz, by dexterity and intuition of symptoms, caught up
by the road, with what a mutual joy! As had been expected,
August Christian, on sight of Görtz, with an armed Frederick
looming in the distance, took at once into new courses and activities.
From him no consent now; far other: treaty with Frederick;
flat refusal ever to consent: application to the Reich, application
even to France, and whatever a gallant young fellow
could do.</p>

<p>“Frederick was in very weak health in these months; still
considered by the gazetteers to be dying. But it appears he is
not yet too weak for taking, on the instant necessary, a world-important
resolution; and of being on the road with it, to this
issue or to that, at full speed before the day closed. ‘Desist,
good neighbor, I beseech you. You must desist, and even you
shall:’ this resolution was entirely his own, as were the equally
prompt arrangements he contrived for executing it, should hard
come to hard, and Austria prefer war to doing justice.”<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></p>

<p>While pushing these intrigues of diplomacy, Frederick was
equally busy in marshaling his armies, that the sword might contribute
its energies to the enforcement of his demands. One
hundred thousand troops were assembled in Berlin, in the highest
state of discipline and equipment, ready to march at a moment’s
warning.</p>

<p>On Sunday, April 5, 1778, Frederick reviewed these troops,
and addressed his officers in a speech, which was published in
the newspapers to inform Austria what she had to expect. Eager
as Frederick was to enlarge his own dominions, he was by
no means disposed to grant the same privilege to other and rival
nations. The address of Frederick to his officers was in reality
a declaration to the Austrian court.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Frederick, “I have assembled you here for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span>
public object. Most of you, like myself, have often been in arms
with one another, and are grown gray in the service of our country.
To all of us is well known in what dangers, toils, and renown
we have been fellow-sharers. I doubt not in the least that
all of you, as myself, have a horror of bloodshed; but the danger
which now threatens our countries not only renders it a duty,
but puts us in the absolute necessity, to adopt the quickest and
most effectual means for dissipating at the right time the storm
which threatens to break out upon us.</p>

<p>“I depend with complete confidence on your soldierly and patriotic
zeal, which is already well and gloriously known to me,
and which, while I live, I will acknowledge with the heartiest
satisfaction. Before all things I recommend to you, and prescribe
as your most sacred duty, that in every situation you exercise
humanity on unarmed enemies. In this respect, let there be the
strictest discipline kept among those under you.</p>

<p>“To travel with the pomp of a king is not among my wishes,
and all of you are aware that I have no pleasure in rich field-furniture;
but my increasing age, and the weakness it brings,
render me incapable of riding as I did in my youth. I shall,
therefore, be obliged to make use of a post-chaise in times of
marching, and all of you have liberty to do the same. But on
the day of battle you shall see me on horseback; and there, also,
I hope my generals will follow that example.”</p>

<p>Kaunitz, the Austrian prime minister, was by no means prepared
for this decisive action. In less than a week Frederick
had one hundred thousand soldiers on the frontiers. Austria
had not ten thousand there to meet them. Kaunitz, quite alarmed,
assumed a supplicatory tone, and called for negotiation.</p>

<p>“Must there be war?” he said. “I am your majesty’s friend.
Can we not, in mutual concession, find agreement?”</p>

<p>The result was a congress of three persons, two Prussians and
one Austrian, which congress met at Berlin on the 24th of May,
1778. For two months they deliberated. The Austrians improved
the delay in making very vigorous preparations for war.
Frederick really wished to avoid the war, for he had seen enough
of the woes of battle. They could come to no agreement.</p>

<p>On the 3d of July Frederick issued his declaration of war.
On that very day his solid battalions, one hundred thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span>
strong, with menacing banners and defiant bugle-notes, crossed
the border, and encamped on Bohemian ground. At the same
moment, the king’s brother, Prince Henry, with another army of
one hundred thousand men, commenced a march from the west
to co-operate in an impetuous rush upon Vienna. These tidings
caused the utmost consternation in the Austrian capital. An
eye-witness writes:</p>

<p>“The terror in Vienna was dreadful. I will not attempt to
describe the dismay the tidings excited among all ranks of people.
Maria Theresa, trembling for her two sons who were in the
army, immediately dispatched an autograph letter to Frederick
with new proposals for a negotiation.”</p>

<p>Frederick had not grown old gracefully. He was domineering,
soured, and irritable, finding fault with every body and every
thing. As his troops were getting into camp at Jaromirtz
on the 8th of July, the king, weary with riding, threw himself
upon the ground for a little rest, his adjutants being near him.
A young officer was riding by. Frederick beckoned to him, and
wrote, with his pencil, an order of not the slightest importance,
and said to the officer, aloud, in the hearing of all, purposely to
wound their feelings,</p>

<p>“Here, take that order to General Lossow, and tell him that
he is not to take it ill that I trouble him, as I have none in my
suite that can do any thing.” It often seemed to give Frederick
pleasure, and never pain, to wound the feelings of others.</p>

<p>“On arriving with his column,” writes General Schmettau,
“where the officer—a perfectly skillful man—had marked out
the camp, the king would lift his spy-glass, gaze to right and
left, riding round the place at perhaps a hundred yards distance,
and begin, ‘Look here, sir, what a botching you have made of it
again!’</p>

<p>“And then, grumbling and blaming, would alter the camp till
it was all out of rule, and then say,</p>

<p>“‘See there; that is the way to mark out camps.’”<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p>

<p>Through the efforts of Maria Theresa there was another brief
conference, but it amounted to nothing. Neither party wished
for war. But Austria craved the annexation of Bavaria, and
Frederick was determined that Austria should not thus be enlarged.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">557</span>
Thus the summer passed away in unavailing diplomacy
and in equally unavailing military manœuvrings. While
engaged in these adventures, Frederick received the tidings of
the death of Voltaire, who breathed his last on the 20th of May,
1778. The soul of Frederick was too much seared by life’s stern
conflicts to allow him to manifest, or probably to feel, any emotion
on the occasion. He, however, wrote a eulogy upon the renowned
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">littérateur</i>, which, though written by a royal pen, attracted
but little attention.</p>

<p>During the winter Russia and France interposed in behalf of
peace. The belligerents agreed to submit the question to their
decision. Austria was permitted to take a small slice of Bavaria,
and for a time the horrors of war were averted.</p>

<p>Soon after this an event occurred very characteristic of the
king—an event which conspicuously displayed both his good
and bad qualities. A miller was engaged in a lawsuit against
a nobleman. The decree of the court, after a very careful examination,
was unanimously in favor of the nobleman; the king,
who had impulsively formed a different opinion of the case, was
greatly exasperated. He summoned the four judges before him,
denounced them in the severest terms of vituperation, would listen
to no defense, and dismissed them angrily from office.</p>

<p>“May a miller,” he exclaimed, fiercely, “who has no water, and
consequently can not grind, have his mill taken from him? Is
that just? Here is a nobleman wishing to make a fish-pond.
To get more water for his pond, he has a ditch dug to draw into
it a small stream which drives a water-mill. Thereby the miller
loses his water, and can not grind. Yet, in spite of this, it is
pretended that the miller shall pay his rent, quite the same as
at the time when he had full water for his mill. Of course he
can not pay his rent. His incomings are gone.</p>

<p>“And what does the court of Cüstrin do? It orders the mill
to be sold, that the nobleman may have his rent! Go you, sir,”
addressing the grand chancellor, “about your business, this instant.
Your successor is appointed; with you I have nothing
more to do.” The other three were assailed in the same way,
but still more vehemently, as the king’s wrath flamed higher
and higher. “Out of my sight,” he exclaimed at last; “I will
make an example of you which shall be remembered.”</p>

    <div class="caption">CONDEMNATION OF THE JUDGES.</div></div>

<p>The next day, December 11, 1779, the king issued the following
protocol in the newspapers:</p>

<p>“The king’s desire always was and is that every body, be he
high or low, rich or poor, get prompt justice. Wherefore, in respect
to this most unjust sentence against the miller Arnold,
pronounced in the Neumark, and confirmed here in Berlin, his
majesty will establish an emphatic example, to the end that all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">559</span>
the courts of justice in the king’s provinces may take warning
thereby, and not commit the like glaring unjust acts. For let
them bear in mind that the least peasant, yea, what is still more,
that even a beggar, is, no less than his majesty, a human being,
and one to whom due justice must be meted out. All men being
equal before the law, if it is a prince complaining against a
peasant, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versa</i>, the prince is the same as the peasant before
the law.</p>

<p>“Let the courts take this for their rule; and whenever they
do not carry out justice in a straightforward manner, without
any regard of person and rank, they shall have to answer to his
majesty for it.”</p>

<p>The discarded judges were arrested, imprisoned for a year, and
fined a sum of money equal to the supposed loss of the miller.
In this case the judges had heard both sides of the question, and
the king but one side. The question had been justly decided.
The case was so clear that the new judges appointed by the king,
being conscientious men, could not refrain from sustaining the
verdict. Still the king, who would never admit that he was in
the wrong, ordered no redress for those who had thus suffered
for righteousness sake. After Frederick’s death the court compelled
the miller to refund the money which had been so unjustly
extorted for damages.</p>

<p>On the 29th of November, 1780, Maria Theresa died. The
extraordinary character which she had developed through life
was equally manifested in the hour of death. She died of congestion
of the lungs, which created a painful and suffocating difficulty
of breathing. Her struggles for breath rendered it impossible
for her to lie upon the bed. Bolstered in her chair, she
leaned her head back as if inclined to sleep.</p>

<p>“Will your majesty sleep, then?” inquired an attendant.</p>

<p>“No,” the empress replied; “I could sleep, but I must not.
Death is too near. He must not steal upon me. These fifteen
years I have been making ready for him; I will meet him
awake.”</p>

<p>For fifteen years she had been a mourning widow. Her husband
had died on the 18th of August. The 18th day of every
month had since then been a day of solitary prayer. On the
18th of every August she descended into the tomb, and sat for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span>
a season engaged in prayer by the side of the mouldering remains
of her spouse.</p>

<div id="ip_560" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.875em;">

    <div class="caption">MARIA THERESA AT THE TOMB OF HER HUSBAND.</div></div>

<p>The Emperor Joseph had been embarrassed in his ambitious
plans by the conscientious scruples of his mother. He now entered
into a secret alliance with the Czarina Catharine, by which
he engaged to assist her in her advance to Constantinople, while
she, in her turn, was to aid him in his encroachments and annexations
to establish an empire in the West as magnificent as the
czarina hoped to establish in the East.</p>

<p>Delighted with this plan, and sanguine in the hope of its successful
accomplishment, the czarina named her next grandson
Constantine. Austria and Russia thus became allied, with all
their sympathies hostile to Frederick. Old age and infirmities
were stealing upon the king apace. Among the well-authenticated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">561</span>
anecdotes related of him, the following is given by Carlyle:</p>

<p>“Loss of time was one of the losses Frederick could least stand.
In visits, even from his brothers and sisters, which were always
by his own express invitation, he would say some morning (call
it Tuesday morning), ‘You are going on Wednesday, I am sorry
to hear’ (what <em>you</em> never heard before). ‘Alas! your majesty,
we must.’ ‘Well, I am sorry; but I will lay no constraint on
you. Pleasant moments can not last forever.’ This trait is in
the anecdote-books; but its authenticity does not rest on that
uncertain basis. Singularly enough, it comes to me individually,
by two clear stages, from Frederick’s sister, the Duchess of Brunswick,
who, if any body, would know it well.”</p>

<p>We have often spoken of the entire neglect with which the
king treated his virtuous and amiable queen. Preuss relates
the following incident:</p>

<p>“When the king, after the Seven Years’ War, now and then
in carnival season dined with the queen in her apartments, he
usually said not a word to her. He merely, on entering, on sitting
down at table, and leaving it, made the customary bows,
and sat opposite to her. Once the queen was ill of gout. The
table was in her apartments, but she was not there. She sat in
an easy-chair in the drawing-room. On this occasion the king
stepped up to the queen and inquired about her health. The
circumstance occasioned among the company present, and all
over the town, as the news spread, great wonder and sympathy.
This is probably the last time he ever spoke to her.”<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></p>

<p>“The king was fond of children; he liked to have his grand-nephews
about him. One day, while the king sat at work in
his cabinet, the younger of the two, a boy of eight or nine, was
playing ball about the room, and knocked it once and again into
the king’s writing operation, who twice or oftener flung it back
to him, but next time put it in his pocket, and went on. ‘Please
your majesty, give it me back,’ begged the boy, and again begged:
majesty took no notice; continued writing. Till at length
came, in the tone of indignation, ‘Will your majesty give me my
ball, then?’ The king looked up; found the little Hohenzollern
planted firm, hands on haunches, and wearing quite a peremptory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span>
air. ‘Thou art a brave little fellow. They won’t get Silesia
out of thee?’ cried he, laughing, and flinging him his ball.”<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<p>The fault-finding character of the king, and his intense devotion
to perfecting his army, both increased with his advancing
years. After one of his reviews of the troops in Silesia, in the
year 1784, he wrote in the following severe strain to the commanding
general:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
“Potsdam, September 7, 1784.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear General</span>,—While in Silesia I mentioned to you,
and will now repeat in writing, that my army in Silesia was at
no time so bad as at present. Were I to make shoemakers or
tailors into generals, the regiments could not be worse. Regiment
Thadden is not fit to be the most insignificant militia battalion
of a Prussian army. Of the regiment Erlach, the men are
so spoiled by smuggling they have no resemblance to soldiers;
Keller is like a heap of undrilled boors; Hager has a miserable
commander; and your own regiment is very mediocre. Only
with Graf Von Anhalt, with Wendessen, and Markgraf Heinrich
could I be content. See you, that is the state I found the regiments
in, one after one. I will now speak of their manœuvring.</p>

<p>“Schwartz, at Neisse, made the unpardonable mistake of not
sufficiently besetting the height on the left wing; had it been
serious, the battle had been lost. At Breslau, Erlach, instead of
covering the army by seizing the heights, marched off with his
division straight as a row of cabbages into that defile; whereby,
had it been earnest, the enemy’s cavalry would have cut down
our infantry, and the fight was gone.</p>

<p>“It is not my purpose to lose battles by the base conduct of
my generals; wherefore I hereby appoint that you, next year,
if I be alive, assemble the army between Breslau and Ohlau;
for four days before I arrive in your camp, carefully manœuvre
with the ignorant generals, and teach them what their duty is.
Regiment Von Arnim and regiment Von Kanitz are to act the
enemy; and whoever does not then fulfill his duty shall go to
court-martial; for I should think it a shame of any country to
keep such people, who trouble themselves so little about their
business.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">563</span>
The king seemed to think it effeminate and a disgrace to him
as a soldier ever to appear in a carriage. He never <em>drove</em>, but
constantly <em>rode</em> from Berlin to Potsdam. In the winter of 1785,
when he was quite feeble, he wished to go from Sans Souci,
which was exposed to bleak winds, and where they had only
hearth fires, to more comfortable winter quarters in the new palace.
The weather was stormy. After waiting a few days for
such a change as would enable him to go on horseback, and the
cold and wind increasing, he was taken over in a sedan-chair in
the night, when no one could see him.</p>

<p>In August, 1785, the king again visited Silesia to review his
troops. A private letter, quoted by Carlyle, gives an interesting
view of his appearance at the time:</p>

<p>“He passed through Hirschberg on the 18th of August. A
concourse of many thousands had been waiting for him several
hours. Outriders came at last; then he himself, the unique;
and, with the liveliest expression of reverence and love, all eyes
were directed on one point. I can not describe to you my feelings,
which, of course, were those of every body, to see him, the
aged king; in his weak hand the hat; in those grand eyes such
a fatherly benignity of look over the vast crowd that encircled
his carriage, and rolled tide-like, accompanying it. Looking
round, I saw in various eyes a tear trembling.</p>

<p>“His affability, his kindliness, to whoever had the honor of
speech with this great king, who shall describe it! After talking
a good while with the merchants’ deputation from the hill
country, he said, ‘Is there any thing more, then, from any body?’
Upon which the president stepped forward and said, ‘The burned-out
inhabitants of Greiffenberg have charged me to express
once more their most submissive gratitude for the gracious help
in rebuilding; their word of thanks is indeed of no importance;
but they daily pray God to reward such royal beneficence.’ The
king was visibly affected, and said, ‘You don’t need to thank
me; when my subjects fall into misfortune, it is my duty to help
them up again; for that reason am I here.’”</p>

<p>On Monday, the 22d of August, the great review commenced
near Strehlen. It lasted four days. All the country mansions
around were filled with strangers who had come to witness the
spectacle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">564</span>
“The sure fact, and the forever memorable, is that on Wednesday,
the third day of it, from four in the morning, when the manœuvres
began, till well after ten o’clock, when they ended, there
was rain like Noah’s; rain falling as from buckets and water-spouts;
and that Frederick, so intent upon his business, paid not
the slightest regard to it, but rode about, intensely inspecting, in
lynx-eyed watchfulness of every thing, as if no rain had been
there. Was not at the pains even to put on his cloak. Six
hours of such down-pour; and a weakly old man of seventy-three
past! Of course he was wetted to the bone. On returning to
head-quarters, his boots were found full of water; ‘when pulled
off, it came pouring from them like a pair of pails.’”<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></p>

    <div class="caption">THE LAST REVIEW.</div></div>

<p>Lafayette, Lord Cornwallis, and the Duke of York were his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span>
guests at the dinner-table that day. The king suffered from his
exposure, was very feverish, and at an early hour went to bed.
The next day he completed his review; and the next day “went—round
by Neisse, inspection not to be omitted there, though it
doubles the distance—to Brieg, a drive of eighty miles, inspection
work included.”<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></p>

<p>From this exhausting journey for so old a man the king returned
to Potsdam through a series of state dinners, balls, and
illuminations. On the night of the 18th of September he was
awoke by a very severe fit of suffocation. It was some time before
he could get any relief, and it was thought that he was dying.
The next day gout set in severely. This was followed by
dropsy. The king suffered severely through the winter. There
is no royal road through the sick-chamber to the tomb. The
weary months of pain and languor came and went. The renowned
Mirabeau visited the king in his sick-chamber on the
17th of April, 1786. He writes:</p>

<p>“My dialogue with the king was very lively; but the king
was in such suffering, and so straitened for breath, I was myself
anxious to shorten it. That same evening I traveled on.”</p>

<p>That same evening Marie Antoinette wrote from Versailles to
her sister Christine at Brussels:</p>

<p>“The King of Prussia is thought to be dying. I am weary
of the political discussions on this subject as to what effects his
death must produce. He is better at this moment, but so weak
he can not resist long. Physique is gone. But his force and
energy of soul, they say, have often supported him, and in desperate
crises have even seemed to increase. Liking to him I
never had. His ostentatious immorality has much hurt public
virtue, and there have been related to me barbarities which excite
horror.</p>

<p>“He has done us all a great deal of ill. He has been king for
his own country, but a trouble-feast for those about him—setting
up to be the arbiter of Europe, always assailing his neighbors,
and making them pay the expense. As daughters of Maria
Theresa, it is impossible we can regret him; nor is it the court
of France that will make his funeral oration.”<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p>The Prince of Ligne, a very accomplished courtier, about this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span>
time visited the sick and dying king. During his brief stay he
dined daily with the king, and spent his evenings with him. In
an interesting account which he gives of these interviews, he
writes:</p>

<p>“Daily for five hours the universality of his conversation completed
my enchantment at his powers. The arts, war, medicine,
literature, religion, philosophy, morality, history, and legislation
passed in review by turns. The great times of Augustus and
Louis XIV.; the good society among the Romans, the Greeks,
and the French; the chivalry of Francis I.; the valor of Henry
IV.; the revival of letters, and their changes since Leo X.; anecdotes
of men of talent of former days, and their errors; the eccentricities
of Voltaire; the sensitive vanity of Maupertuis; the
agreeableness of Algarotti; the wit of Jordan; the hypochondriacism
of the Marquis D’Argens, whom the king used to induce
to keep his bed for four-and-twenty hours by merely telling him
he looked ill—and what not besides? All that could be said of
the most varied and agreeable kind was what came from him, in
a gentle tone of voice, rather low, and very agreeable from his
manner of moving his lips, which possessed an inexpressible
grace.”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></p>

<p>Dr. Moore gives the following account of a surprising scene,
considering that the king was an infirm and suffering man seventy-three
years of age:</p>

<p>“A few days ago I happened to take a very early walk about
a mile from Potsdam, and seeing some soldiers under arms in a
field at a small distance from the road, I went toward them. An
officer on horseback, whom I took to be the major, for he gave
the word of command, was uncommonly active, and often rode
among the ranks to reprimand or instruct the common men.
When I came nearer I was much surprised to find that this was
the king himself.</p>

<p>“He had his sword drawn, and continued to exercise the corps
for an hour after. He made them wheel, march, form the square,
and fire by divisions and in platoons, observing all their motions
with infinite attention; and, on account of some blunder, put
two officers of the Prince of Prussia’s regiment in arrest. In short,
he seemed to exert himself with all the spirit of a young officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">567</span>
eager to attract the notice of his general by uncommon alertness.”<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></p>

<div id="ip_567" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28.6875em;">
  <img src="images/i_567.jpg" width="459" height="460" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">FREDERICK AND HIS DOGS.</div></div>

<p>Frederick was very fond of dogs. This was one of his earliest
passions, and it continued until the end of his life. He almost
invariably had five or six Italian greyhounds about him, leaping
upon the chairs, and sleeping upon the sofas in his room. Dr.
Zimmermann describes them as placed on blue satin chairs and
couches near the king’s arm-chair, and says that when Frederick,
during his last illness, used to sit on his terrace at Sans Souci in
order to enjoy the sun, a chair was always placed by his side,
which was occupied by one of his dogs. He fed them himself,
took the greatest possible care of them when they were sick, and
when they died buried them in the gardens of Sans Souci. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">568</span>
traveler may still see their tombs—flat stones with the names of
the dogs beneath engraved upon them—at each end of the terrace
of Sans Souci, in front of the palace.</p>

<p>“The king was accustomed to pass his leisure moments in
playing with them, and the room where he sat was strewed with
leather balls with which they amused themselves. As they were
all much indulged, though there was always one especial favorite,
they used to tear the damask covers of the chairs in the king’s
apartment, and gnaw and otherwise injure the furniture. This
he permitted without rebuke, and used only to say,</p>

<p>“‘My dogs destroy my chairs; but how can I help it? And if
I were to have them mended to-day, they would be torn again
to-morrow. So I suppose I must bear with the inconvenience.
After all, a Marquise De Pompadour would cost me a great deal
more, and would neither be as attached nor as faithful.’”</p>

<p>One of Frederick’s dogs, Biche, has attained almost historic
celebrity. We can not vouch for the authenticity of the anecdote,
but it is stated that the king took Biche with him on the campaign
of 1745. One day the king, advancing on a reconnoissance,
was surprised and pursued by a large number of Austrians. He
took refuge under a bridge, and, wrapping Biche in his cloak,
held him close to his breast. The sagacious animal seemed fully
conscious of the peril of his master. Though of a very nervous
temperament, and generally noisy and disposed to bark at the
slightest disturbance, he remained perfectly quiet until the Austrians
had passed.</p>

<p>At the battle of Sohr, Biche was taken captive with the king’s
baggage. The animal manifested so much joy upon being restored
to its master that the king’s eyes were flooded with tears.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July the king rode out for the last time. Not
long after, the horse was again brought to the door, but the king
found himself too weak to mount. Still, while in this state of extreme
debility and pain, he conducted the affairs of state with
the most extraordinary energy and precision. The minutest
questions received his attention, and every branch of business
was prosecuted with as much care and perfection as in his best
days.</p>

<p>“He saw his ministers, saw all who had business with him,
many who had little; and in the sore coil of bodily miseries, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">569</span>
Hertzberg observed with wonder, never was the king’s intellect
clearer, or his judgment more just and decisive. Of his disease,
except to the doctors, he spoke no word to any body.</p>

<p>“The body of Frederick is a ruin, but his soul is still here,
and receives his friends and his tasks as formerly. Asthma,
dropsy, erysipelas, continual want of sleep; for many months
past he has not been in bed, but sits day and night in an easy-chair,
unable to get breath except in that posture. He said one
morning to somebody entering, ‘If you happened to want a night-watcher,
I could suit you well.’”<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></p>

<p>There is something truly sublime in the devotion with which
he, in disregard of sleeplessness, exhaustion, and pain, gave himself
to work. His three clerks were summoned to his room each
morning at four o’clock.</p>

<p>“My situation forces me,” he said, “to give them this trouble,
which they will not have to suffer long. My life is on the decline.
The time which I still have belongs not to me, but to the
state.”</p>

<p>He conversed cheerfully upon literature, history, and the common
topics of the day. But he seemed studiously to avoid any
allusion to God, to the subject of religion, or to death. He had
from his early days very emphatically expressed his disbelief in
any God who took an interest in the affairs of men. Throughout
his whole life he had abstained from any recognition of such
a God by any known acts of prayer or worship. Still Mr. Carlyle
writes:</p>

<p>“From of old, life has been infinitely contemptible to him. In
death, I think, he has neither fear nor hope. Atheism, truly, he
never could abide: to him, as to all of us, it was flatly inconceivable
that intellect, moral emotion, could have been put into <em>him</em>
by an Entity that had none of its own. But there, pretty much,
his Theism seems to have stopped. Instinctively; too, he believed,
no man more firmly, that Right alone has ultimately any strength
in this world: ultimately, yes; but for him and his poor brief
interests, what good was it? Hope for himself in divine Justice,
in divine Providence, I think he had not practically any: that
the unfathomable Demiurgus should concern himself with such
a set of paltry, ill-given animalcules as one’s self and mankind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">570</span>
are, this also, as we have often noticed, is in the main incredible
to him.</p>

<p>“Inarticulate notions, fancies, transient aspirations, he might
have, in the background of his mind. One day, sitting for a while
out of doors, gazing into the sun, he was heard to murmur, ‘Perhaps
I shall be nearer thee soon;’ and, indeed, nobody knows
what his thoughts were in these final months. There is traceable
only a complete superiority to fear and hope; in parts, too,
are half glimpses of a great motionless interior lake of sorrow,
sadder than any tears or complainings, which are altogether
wanting to it.”</p>

<p>Dr. Zimmermann, whose work on Solitude had given him some
renown, had been sent for to administer to the illustrious patient.
His prescriptions were of no avail. On the 10th of August,
1786, Frederick wrote to his sister, the Duchess Dowager
of Brunswick:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My adorable Sister</span>,—The Hanover doctor has wished to
make himself important with you, my good sister; but the truth
is, he has been of no use to me. The old must give place to the
young, that each generation may find room clear for it; and life,
if we examine strictly what its course is, consists in seeing one’s
fellow-creatures die and be born. In the mean while, I have felt
myself a little easier for the last day or two. My heart remains
inviolably attached to you, my good sister. With the highest
consideration, my adorable sister, your faithful brother and servant,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Frederick</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>The last letter which it is supposed that he wrote was the following
cold epistle to his excellent wife, whom, through a long
life, he had treated with such cruel neglect:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,—I am much obliged by the wishes you deign to
form; but a heavy fever I have taken hinders me from answering
you.”</p>

<p>Scarcely any thing can be more sad than the record of the last
days and hours of this extraordinary man. Few of the children
of Adam have passed a more joyless life. Few have gone down
to a grave shrouded with deeper gloom. None of those Christian
hopes which so often alleviate pain, and take from death its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">571</span>
sting, cheered his dying chamber. To him the grave was but
the portal to the abyss of annihilation.</p>

<p>Days of pain and nights of sleeplessness were his portion. A
hard cough racked his frame. His strength failed him. Ulcerous
sores broke out upon various parts of his body. A constant
oppression at his chest rendered it impossible for him to lie
down. Gout tortured him. His passage to the grave led
through eighteen months of constant suffering. Dr. Zimmermann,
in his diary of the 2d of August, writes:</p>

<p>“The king is very chilly, and is always enveloped in pelisses,
and covered with feather-beds. He has not been in bed for six
weeks, but sleeps in his chair for a considerable time together,
and always turned to the right side. The dropsical swelling
augments. He sees it, but will not perceive what it is, or at
least will not appear to do so, but talks as if it were a swelling
accompanying convalescence, and proceeding from previous weakness.
He is determined not to die if violent remedies can save
him, but to submit to punctures and incisions to draw off the
water.”</p>

<p>Again, on the 8th, Dr. Zimmermann wrote: “The king is extraordinarily
ill. On the 4th erysipelas appeared on the leg.
This announces bursting and mortification. He has much oppression,
and the smell of the wound is very bad.”</p>

<p>On the 15th, after a restless night, he did not wake until eleven
o’clock in the morning. For a short time he seemed confused.
He then summoned his generals and secretaries, and gave his orders
with all his wonted precision. He then called in his three
clerks and dictated to them upon various subjects. His directions
to an embassador, who was about leaving, filled four quarto pages.</p>

<p>As night came on he fell into what may be called the death-sleep.
His breathing was painful and stertorous; his mind was
wandering in delirious dreams; his voice became inarticulate.
At a moment of returning consciousness he tried several times
in vain to give some utterance to his thoughts. Then, with a
despairing expression of countenance, he sank back upon his pillow.
Fever flushed his cheeks, and his eyes assumed some of
their wonted fire. Thus the dying hours were prolonged, as the
friendless monarch, surrounded by respectful attendants, slowly
descended to the grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">572</span>
His feet and legs became cold. Death was stealing its way
toward the vitals. About nine o’clock Wednesday evening a
painful cough commenced, with difficulty of breathing, and an
ominous rattle in the throat. One of his dogs sat by his bedside,
and shivered with cold; the king made a sign for them to
throw a quilt over it.</p>

<p>Another severe fit of coughing ensued, and the king, having
with difficulty got rid of the phlegm, said, “The mountain is
passed; we shall be better now.” These were his last words.
The expiring monarch sat in his chair, but in a state of such extreme
weakness that he was continually sinking down, with his
chest and neck so bent forward that breathing was almost impossible.
One of his faithful valets took the king upon his knee
and placed his left arm around his waist, while the king threw
his right arm around the valet’s neck.</p>

<p>It was midnight. “Within doors all is silence; around it the
dark earth is silent, above it the silent stars.” Thus for two
hours the attendant sat motionless, holding the dying king.
Not a word was spoken; no sound could be heard but the painful
breathing which precedes death.</p>

<p>At just twenty minutes past two o’clock the breathing ceased,
the spirit took its flight, and the lifeless body alone remained.
Life’s great battle was ended, and the soul of the monarch ascended
to that dread tribunal where prince and peasant must
alike answer for all the deeds done in the body. It was the
17th of August, 1786. The king had reigned forty-six years,
and had lived seventy-six years, six months, and twenty-four
days.</p>

<p>One clause in the king’s will was judiciously disregarded.
As a last mark of his contempt for his own species, Frederick
had directed that he should be buried at Sans Souci by the side
of his dogs.</p>

<p>In the king’s will, the only reference to any future which might
be before him was the following:</p>

<p>“After having restored peace to my kingdom; after having
conquered countries, raised a victorious army, and filled my treasury;
after having established a good administration throughout
my dominions; after having made my enemies tremble, I resign,
without regret, this breath of life to Nature.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">573</span>
He left a small sum for the support of his amiable, blameless,
and neglected queen, saying, “She never gave me the least uneasiness
during my whole reign, and she merits every attention
and respect for her many and unshaken virtues.”</p>

<p>“All next day the body lay in state in the palace; thousands
crowding, from Berlin and the other environs, to see that face for
the last time. Wasted, worn, but beautiful in death, with the
thin gray hair parted into locks, and slightly powdered.”<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p>At eight o’clock in the evening his body was borne, accompanied
by a battalion of the Guards, to Potsdam; eight horses
drew the hearse. An immense concourse, in silence and sadness,
filled the streets. He was buried in a small chapel in the church
of the garrison at Potsdam. There the remains of Frederick
and his father repose side by side.</p>

wished immediately to succeed his own. He desired us likewise to omit, in his reception, not
any one rigorous ceremony that was used in similar cases; to grant him no indulgence whatever;
but gave us leave, on this occasion, to treat him merely as a private person. In a word,
he was received with all the usual and requisite formalities. I admired his intrepidity, the serenity
of his countenance, and his graceful deportment even in the most critical moments. After

that men of the ordinary stature should think of such an attempt. The same question

gift he received from the king soon after his accession to the throne: “He began his reign by
sending an embassador extraordinary to France, one Camas, who had lost an arm. He said
that, as there was a minister from the French court at Berlin who had but one hand, he, that he
might acquit himself of all obligation toward the most Christian king, had sent him an embassador
with one arm. Camas, as soon as he arrived safe at his inn, dispatched a lad to tell me
that he was too much fatigued to come to my house, and therefore begged that I would come
to him instantly, he having the finest, greatest, and most magnificent present that was ever presented
to make me on the part of the king his master. ‘Run, run, as fast as you can,’ said
Madame Du Châtelet; ‘he has assuredly sent you the diamonds of the crown.’ Away I ran,
and found my embassador, whose only baggage was a small keg of wine, tied behind his chaise,
sent from the cellar of the late king by the reigning monarch, with a royal command for me to
drink. I emptied myself in protestations of astonishment and gratitude for these <em>liquid</em> marks
of his majesty’s bounty, instead of the <em>solid</em> ones I had been taught to expect, and divided my
keg with Camas.”—<cite>Memoirs</cite>, p. 34.</p></div>

century, and as Frederick William had not, any more than his predecessors, adopted any vigorous
measures to gain possession of them, it is not probable that the claim of Frederick was very well
founded. At all events, his conduct was violent and unjust. The inhabitants of these districts
had been guilty of no crime but that of avowing their allegiance to the prince whom they had
been accustomed to obey, and whom they appear to have considered as their lawful sovereign.
When Frederick, therefore, sent his troops to live upon the inhabitants of those districts at discretion,
he committed an act of tyranny and of cruelty which nothing in the circumstances of
the case could justify.”—<cite>Memoirs of Voltaire</cite>, p. 44.</p></div>

commanded him to write to Marshal Schwerin and M. Von Podewils, Minister for Foreign Affairs,
and order them to come immediately to Reinsberg. These gentlemen arrived forthwith.

been compelled, by hard usage on the part of the court of Vienna, to waive those pretensions.
It is certain that, whoever might have been originally in the right, Prussia had submitted.
Prince after prince of the house of Brandenburg had acquiesced in the existing arrangement.
Nay, the court of Berlin had recently been allied with that of Vienna, and had guaranteed
the integrity of the Austrian states. Is it not perfectly clear that, if antiquated claims are

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> In this wicked world power seldom respects weakness. No sooner was the emperor dead
than four claimants sprang up to wrest from Maria Theresa a part or the whole of the kingdoms
she had inherited from her father; and this, notwithstanding nearly all the powers of Europe
had guaranteed the Pragmatic Sanction. The Elector of Bavaria claimed Bohemia, from an
article in the will of the Emperor Ferdinand I., made two centuries before. The King of Poland
demanded the whole Austrian succession, in virtue of the right of his wife, who was the
eldest daughter of the Emperor Joseph, elder brother of Charles VI. The King of Spain
claimed all the Austrian possessions, in consequence of his descent from the wife of Philip II.,
who was daughter of the Emperor Maximilian. The King of Sardinia hunted up an obsolete
claim to the duchy of Milan. But for the embarrassment into which these claims plunged Maria
Theresa, Frederick would hardly have ventured to invade the province of Silesia. The woes
which, in consequence, desolated the nations of Europe, no mind but that of the omniscient God
can gauge.</p></div>

in Berlin, and had been a preacher. The death of a beloved wife, leaving him with an only
daughter, had plunged him into the profoundest melancholy. Frederick, when Crown Prince,
took a great fancy to him, making him nominally his reader, giving him charge of his library.
He is represented as a man of small figure, genial, and affectionate, of remarkable vivacity, very
courteous, and one who was ever careful never, by word or action, to give pain to others.</p></div>

Frederick. Being the son of wealthy parents, he had enjoyed great advantages of study and
travel, had already published several works, and was quite distinguished as a universal genius,
a logician, a poet, a philosopher, and a connoisseur in all the arts. He was a great favorite of
Frederick, and accompanied him to Strasbourg and on this expedition to Silesia. Wilhelmina
describes him as “one of the first <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beaux esprits</i> of the age,” and “as one who does the expenses

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_51" href="#FNanchor_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau was one of the most extraordinary men of any age. His life
was but a constant whirlwind of battle, almost from his birth in 1676, to his death in 1747. His
face was of the “color of gunpowder,” and his fearless, tumultuous soul was in conformity with
the rugged body in which it was incased. The whole character of the man may be inferred
from the following prayer, which it is said he was accustomed to offer before entering battle:
“O God! assist our side. At least, avoid assisting the enemy, and leave the result to me.”
Leopold, called the <em>Old Dessauer</em>, and his son, the <em>Young Leopold</em>, were of essential service to
Frederick in his wars. Pages might be filled illustrative of the character of this eccentric man.</p></div>

man, reveling in voluptuousness. His decisions could always be controlled by an ample
bribe. His sole object seemed to be his own personal luxurious indulgence. “Public affairs,”
he said, “will carry themselves on, provided we do not trouble ourselves about them.”

<p>
Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, in his letters from Dresden, writes: “Now, as every thing of
every kind, from the highest affairs of the state down to operas and hunting, are all in Count
Brühl’s immediate care, I leave you to judge how his post is executed. His expenses are immense.
He keeps three hundred servants and as many horses. It is said, and I believe it, that
he takes money for every thing the king disposes of in Poland, where they frequently have very
great employments to bestow.”</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> It would seem that Voltaire was sent to Frederick as the secret agent and spy of the French
minister. “Voltaire,” writes Macaulay, “was received with every mark of respect and friendship.
The negotiation was of an extraordinary description. Nothing can be conceived more
whimsical than the conferences which took place between the first literary man and the first
practical man of the age, whom a strange weakness had induced to change their parts. The
great poet would talk of nothing but treaties and guarantees, and the king of nothing but metaphors
and rhymes. On one occasion Voltaire put into his majesty’s hand a paper on the state
of Europe, and received it back with verses scrawled on the margin. In secret they both laughed
at each other. Voltaire did not spare the king’s poems, and the king has left on record his
opinion of Voltaire’s diplomacy, saying, ‘He had no credentials, and the whole mission was a
mere farce.’”

<p>
As a specimen of the character of the document above alluded to, we give the following. Voltaire,
in what he deemed a very important state paper, had remarked,

<p>
“The partisans of Austria burn with the desire to open the campaign in Silesia again. Have
you, in that case, any ally but France? And, however potent you are, is an ally useless to
you?”
